<function>
 * After the creation with dc_create_group_chat() the chat is usually unpromoted
 * until the first call to dc_send_text_msg() or another sending function.
 *
 * With unpromoted chats, members can be added
 * and settings can be modified without the need of special status messages being sent.
 *
 * While the core takes care of the unpromoted state on its own,
 * checking the state from the UI side may be useful to decide whether a hint as
 * "Send the first message to allow others to reply within the group"
 * should be shown to the user or not.
 *
 * @memberof dc_chat_t
 * @param chat The chat object.
 * @return 1=chat is still unpromoted, no message was ever send to the chat,
 *     0=chat is not unpromoted, messages were send and/or received
 *     or the chat is not group chat.
