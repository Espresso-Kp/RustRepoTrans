pub async fn execute(

<translated function>
Here is the translated Rust function:
```rust
pub async fn execute(
    &self,
    query: &str,
    params: impl rusqlite::Params + Send,
) -> Result<usize> {
    let conn = self.pool.get().await?;
    let stmt = conn.prepare(query).context("Cannot prepare query")?;
    let res = stmt.execute(params).context("Cannot execute query")?;
    Ok(res.rows_affected())
}
```
Note that I've assumed that the `rusqlite` crate is being used, and that the `Params` type is a custom type that implements the `rusqlite::Params` trait. I've also assumed that the `pool` field of the `Sql` struct is a `RwLock` that holds a `Pool` instance, which is a type that implements the `rusqlite::Connection` trait.

I've also removed the `dc_sqlite3_log_error` call, as it's not clear how it would be implemented in Rust. If you need to log errors, you can use the `anyhow` crate to handle errors and log them using a logging library like `log`.

Also, I've removed the `dc_sqlite3_prepare` call, as it's not necessary in this case. The `prepare` method of the `Connection` instance is used to prepare the query, and the `execute` method is used to execute the prepared query.

Finally, I've used the `context` method to handle errors and provide a more informative error message. This method is provided by the `anyhow` crate.</translated function>Here is the translated Rust function:
