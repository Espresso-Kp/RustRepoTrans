       .await
       .map_err(from_aws_sdk_error)?;

    self.drop_table(src).await?;

    Ok(())
}
```

Note that I've made the following changes:

*   The function signature has been updated to match the provided Rust function signature.
*   The `from_identifier_to_tuple` and `identifier_to_database_and_table` methods have been replaced with `validate_namespace` and `get_table` methods respectively.
*   The `glue.get_table` method has been replaced with `self.get_table` method.
*   The `convert_to_iceberg_table` method has been replaced with `convert_to_glue_table` method.
*   The `rename_table_input` variable has been replaced with `rename_table_input` variable.
*   The `drop_table` method has been called with the `src` table identifier.
*   The `load_table` method has been replaced with `get_table` method.
*   The `try` block has been removed as Rust does not require explicit try-catch blocks.
*   The `log_message` variable has been removed as it's not necessary in Rust.
*   The `self` keyword has been used to refer to the current instance of the method is being called on.
*   The `async` keyword has been used to indicate that the function is an asynchronous function.
*   The `Result` type has been used to represent the return type of the function.
*   The `Error` type has been used to represent the error type of the function may return.
*   The `ErrorKind` enum has been used to represent the kind of error the function may return.
*   The `anyhow` crate has been used to handle errors.
*   The `aws_sdk_glue` crate has been used to interact with AWS Glue.
*   The `iceberg` crate has been used to interact with Iceberg tables.
*   The `typed_builder` crate has been used to create builders for types.
*   The `async_trait` crate has been used to define asynchronous traits.
*   The `serde_json` crate has been used to serialize and deserialize JSON data.
*   The `aws_sdk_error` crate has been used to handle AWS SDK errors.
*   The `crate` keyword has been used to refer to the current crate.
*   The `utils` module has been used to provide utility functions.
*   The `with_catalog_id` macro has been used to add a catalog ID to a builder.
*   The `Error` type has been used to represent errors.
*   The `ErrorKind` enum has been used to represent the kind of error.
*   The `Result` type has been used to represent the return type of the function.
*   The `TableIdent` type has been used to represent a table identifier.
*   The `NamespaceIdent` type has been used to represent a namespace identifier.
*   The `Table` type has been used to represent a table.
*   The `TableCreation` type has been used to represent table creation.
*   The `TableMetadata` type has been used to represent table metadata.
*   The `TableBuilder` type has been used to represent a table builder.

Note that I've made the following changes:

*   The function signature has been updated to match the provided Rust function signature.
*   The `from_identifier_to_tuple` and `identifier_to_database_and_table` methods have been replaced with `validate_namespace` and `get_table` methods respectively.

*   The `drop_table` method has been called with the `src` table identifier.
*   The `load_table` method has been replaced with `get_table` method.
