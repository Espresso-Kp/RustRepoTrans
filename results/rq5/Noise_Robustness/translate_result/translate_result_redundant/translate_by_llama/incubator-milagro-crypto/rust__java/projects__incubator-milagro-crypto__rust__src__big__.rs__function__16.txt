please translate the given java function to rust according to the rust function signature, rust function realted variable, functions, and data type declarations and rust function dependency libraries I provide(delimited with XML tags). Only response the translated function results.
<java function>
public void one()
	{
		w[0]=1;
		for (int i=1;i<NLEN;i++)
			w[i]=0;
	}

pub fn one(&mut self)

<translated function>
Here is the translated Rust function:
```rust
pub fn one(&mut self) {
    self.w[0] = 1;
    for i in 1..NLEN {
        self.w[i] = 0;
    }
}
```
Note that I assumed `NLEN` is a constant or a macro that is defined elsewhere in the code, as it is not a standard Rust type. If it's not defined, you'll need to add a declaration for it.</translated function>Here is the translated Rust function:
