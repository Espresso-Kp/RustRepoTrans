Note that I've assumed that `FP12` and `FP12` are the same type, and `FP12` is the same as `FP12`. Also, I've assumed that `TS` and `TRAP` are constants defined somewhere in the code. 

Also note that I've used `&` to pass references to `FP12` and `FP12` instances, and `&mut` to pass mutable references to `FP12` instances. 

Also note that I've used `clone()` to create new instances of `FP12` and `FP12` when needed. 

Also note that I've used `&` to pass references to `Big` instances, and `&mut` to pass mutable references to `Big` instances.
