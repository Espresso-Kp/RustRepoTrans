please translate the given java function to rust according to the rust function signature, rust function realted variable, functions, and data type declarations and rust function dependency libraries I provide(delimited with XML tags). Only response the translated function results.

pub fn zero(&mut self) {

<translated function>
Here is the translated Rust function:
```rust
pub fn zero(&mut self) {
    for i in 0..NLEN {
        self.w[i] = 0;
    }
}
```
Note that I assumed `Chunk` is a type that can be assigned a value of `0`, if that's not the case, you may need to adjust the translation accordingly.</translated function>Here is the translated Rust function:
