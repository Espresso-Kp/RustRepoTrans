please translate the given python function to rust according to the rust function signature, rust function realted variable, functions, and data type declarations and rust function dependency libraries I provide(delimited with XML tags). Only response the translated function results.

        match self.state {
            PeriodicJobState::Running(..) => true,

<translated function>
The provided Python function is checking whether the job has started but not finished. It looks like the "is_started" and "is_finished" variables in Python correspond to the "Running" and "Waiting" states of a job in Rust. So the translated Rust function could be like this:

```rust
impl<T> PeriodicJob<T> {
    fn is_running(&self) -> bool {
        match self.state {
            PeriodicJobState::Running(_) => true,
            PeriodicJobState::Waiting(_, _) => false,
        }
    }
}
```
Please note that this is a basic approach and real situations could be more complex, e.g., if the "Running" state does not necessarily mean "is_started = True" and the "Waiting" state does not necessarily mean "is_finished = True". If you have such cases, please provide additional details so that we can generate a more accurate translation.</translated function>The provided Python function is checking whether the job has started but not finished.
