<translated function>
In Rust, your Python function can be translated as follows:

```rust
pub fn languages(&self) -> Vec<String> {
    self._languages.iter().map(|e| e.0.clone()).collect::<Vec<String>>()
}
```

Please note that, if `String` is not the actual type of the `e[0]` from Python function, replace it with the actual type.

Another important note is that Rust needs to manage memory usage and lifetimes. This is handled differently compared to Python, where the garbage collector takes care of cleaning up memory. In Rust, when you declare a type with `'static`, it means the type lives for the entire duration of the program. The type in the function signature you provided was `&'static Language`.

However, There is a lack of context about `self._languages` , so I assumed it's `Vec<(String,...)>` type. It's important to adjust the code according to your context. If the `_languages` field is private, make sure to make a getter function for accessing it in Rust.

Also, there is no direct equivalent in Rust for Python's list comprehension, but we can use the `iter()` function to iterate over the items and the `map()` function combined with `collect()` which is a common idiom to transform data in Rust. The `clone()` method is used to create a copy of the item, as Rust enforces strict borrowing rules to prevent data races.</translated function>In Rust, your Python function can be translated as follows:
