The Rust version of your provided Java function could look like this:

```rust
use crate::InputFile;
use bytes::Bytes;
use std::ops::Range;
use std::io::{self, SeekFrom, Write, Read};
use crate::Result;

impl InputFile {
    pub async fn read(&self, range: Range<u64>) -> Result<Bytes, std::io::Error> {
        let mut buffer = vec![0; range.end as usize - range.start as usize];
        let mut file = File::open(&self.path)?;
        file.seek(SeekFrom::Start(range.start))?;
        file.read_exact(&mut buffer)?;
        Ok(Bytes::from(buffer))
    }
}
```

This Rust function named `read` is a method of the `InputFile` struct. It returns a `Bytes` struct inside an `Ok` variant of `Result` if the reading of file range is successful. It returns an `Err` variant of `Result` if there are any I/O errors in the process. Note that the buffer size is determined by a range, similar to the original Java function. The file is opened, a seek operation is performed to reach the start of the range, and then it reads into the buffer. The buffer is then converted into `Bytes` for the return.

Also note that this conversion assumes your `Operator` field in `InputFile` does not affect this operation, mapping directly from the provided Java code. This would need to be adjusted if that is not the case.</translated function>The Rust version of your provided Java function could look like this:
