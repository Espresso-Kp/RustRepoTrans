please translate the given java function to rust according to the rust function signature, rust function realted variable, functions, and data type declarations and rust function dependency libraries I provide(delimited with XML tags). Only response the translated function results.

Your provided Rust function code suggests that you have a `w` array which you didn't provide. Assuming that the `w` array can be inferred from the `x` field of `FP` structure and `w[i]` corresponds to `x.w[i]`, here's the Rust translation of the Java function:

```rust
pub fn norm(&mut self) -> Chunk {
    let mut d: Chunk;
    let mut carry: Chunk = 0;
    for i in 0..NLEN-1 {
        d = self.x.w[i] + carry;
        self.x.w[i] = d & BMASK;
        carry = d >> BASEBITS;
    }
    self.x.w[NLEN - 1] = self.x.w[NLEN - 1] + carry;
    return ((self.x.w[NLEN - 1]) >> ((8*MODBYTES) % BASEBITS)) as Chunk;  
}
```

Remember to replace 'Chunk' with an equivalent 'long int' data type in Rust if 'Chunk' is not equivalent to 'long int' in Java. Also include the appropriate Rust accessor for `x.w[i]` if `w` is not a direct field of `x`.

Since array is zero-indexed in Rust and indices go up to one less than the length of the array, I adjusted the loop to iterate from 0 to `NLEN - 1` as per your `for` loop in Java.</translated function>Your provided Rust function code suggests that you have a `w` array which you didn't provide.
