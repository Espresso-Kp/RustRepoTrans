<translated function>
The translated Rust function from the provided C function would be:

```rust
pub fn degrade_encryption(&mut self, message_time: i64) {
    if self.prefer_encrypt == EncryptPreference::Mutual {
        // degraded_event does not exist in provided peerstate, left as comment to reflect original logic
        // self.degrade_event |= DC_DE_ENCRYPTION_PAUSED;
    }

    self.prefer_encrypt = EncryptPreference::Reset;
    self.last_seen = message_time;
}
```

Please note that it's not possible to perfectly translate the original C function into Rust as there is no equivalent operation available for the `degrade_event |= DC_DE_ENCRYPTION_PAUSED` part given the available related structs and enums. Therefore, in the Rust translation, it's commented out to reflect the original C function's logic. Assertively, there's no `degrade_event` field available in the Rust `Peerstate` struct unlike `dc_apeerstate_t` struct in C provided. There might be required an implementation of a similar field and a corresponding constant, or another operation should be performed there instead, depending on the actual needs of your application in Rust.</translated function>The translated Rust function from the provided C function would be:
