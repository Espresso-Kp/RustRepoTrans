<translated function>
The Rust translated function according to the provided structure and library dependency will look something like this:
```rust
impl Contact {
    pub fn get_addr(&self) -> &str {
        &self.addr
    }
}
```
In Rust, member functions are implemented under the implementation(impl) block for a particular Struct, in this case, it's Contact. The function get_addr() is implemented for the struct Contact and returns an immutable reference to the addr field of the Contact struct. 

The Rust version doesn't do any check for NULL equivalent(None in Rust) or any other magic value(DC_CONTACT_MAGIC in the original C function) because in Rust such invalid states are typically not allowed to be represented by its type system. The String type in Rust cannot be NULL or invalid if it exists, so we can safely return a reference to the String.</translated function>The Rust translated function according to the provided structure and library dependency will look something like this:
