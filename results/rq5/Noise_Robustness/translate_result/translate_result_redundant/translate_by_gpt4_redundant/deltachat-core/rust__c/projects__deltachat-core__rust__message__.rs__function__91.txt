<translated function>
Here is the translated Rust function:

```rust
pub(crate) async fn update_msg_state(
    context: &Context,
    msg_id: MsgId,
    state: MessageState,
) -> Result<()> 
{
    context.inner.sql.execute(
        "UPDATE msgs SET state=? WHERE id=? AND (?=? OR state<?)",
        params![
            state as i32,
            msg_id.0,
            state as i32,
            MessageState::OutDelivered as i32,
            MessageState::OutDelivered as i32
        ]
    ).await?;

    Ok(())
}
```

In this Rust function, I have used the `execute` function of the `Sql` struct to run the update query. This function is included as part of the `Context` struct through the `inner` field. 

The `Params` trait from the `rusqlite` crate is used to bind the given method parameters to the SQL query. 

For query parameters, I implemented enum to integer conversion using `as i32`, and assumed `MsgId` is a tuple struct containing a single `u32` value, which can be extracted using `msg_id.0`.

The `execute` function that I used here is assumed to be asynchronous and it returns a `Result<usize>`, from which we only care if an error occurred.

Please make sure that all assumptions and dependencies in the above function are correct in the actual context of your project.</translated function>Here is the translated Rust function:
