please translate the given c function to rust according to the rust function signature, rust function realted variable, functions, and data type declarations and rust function dependency libraries I provide(delimited with XML tags). Only response the translated function results.

<translated function>
In Rust, since strings are processed differently than in C, this translation will need to include allocation of a new String to hold the result. Here is the equivalent Rust function: 

```rust
fn normalize_addr(addr: &str) -> String {
    let mut addr_normalized = addr.to_string();
    addr_normalized = addr_normalized.trim().to_string();
    if addr_normalized.starts_with("mailto:") {
        addr_normalized = addr_normalized[7..].to_string();
        addr_normalized = addr_normalized.trim().to_string();
    }
    addr_normalized
}
```
Please note: Depending on how your Rust project is set up, you may need to adjust the functions used to match your specific needs or libraries. For example, "trim" function is applied assuming that "dc_trim" trims whitespaces from both ends of the string in original C function`.
Please also note that Rust string slices (`&str`) are read-only. If you need to modify a string (e.g. remove a prefix), you typically work with the `String` data type, which is why this function returns a `String` and not `&str`.</translated function>In Rust, since strings are processed differently than in C, this translation will need to include allocation of a new String to hold the result.
