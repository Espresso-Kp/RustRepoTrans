please translate the given python function to rust according to the rust function signature, rust function dependencies(including function and variable dependencies), and data type declarations and rust function dependency libraries I provide(delimited with XML tags).Please make sure to call the relevant dependencies as much as possible in the translated function Only response the translated function results.

<translated function>
Here's the translated Rust function based on the provided Python function, Rust function signature, dependencies, and libraries:

```rust
fn or(&mut self, lhs: bool, rhs: bool) -> crate::Result<bool> {
    Ok(lhs || rhs)
}
```

This Rust function implements the same logic as the Python function, performing a logical OR operation on the two input boolean values. The function signature matches the provided Rust signature, including the `&mut self` parameter and returning a `crate::Result<bool>`.

The function uses the `||` operator to perform the logical OR operation, which is equivalent to the Python `or` operator. The result is wrapped in `Ok()` to conform to the `crate::Result<bool>` return type.

Note that this function doesn't directly use any of the provided dependencies or libraries, as the original Python function was a simple logical operation that doesn't require additional context or complex data structures.</translated function>Here's the translated Rust function based on the provided Python function, Rust function signature, dependencies, and libraries:
