please translate the given java function to rust according to the rust function signature, rust function dependencies(including function and variable dependencies), and data type declarations and rust function dependency libraries I provide(delimited with XML tags).Please make sure to call the relevant dependencies as much as possible in the translated function Only response the translated function results.

<translated function>
Here's the translated Rust function based on the provided Java function, Rust function signature, dependencies, and libraries:

```rust
pub fn shl(&mut self, k: usize) {
    let n = k % BASEBITS;
    let m = k / BASEBITS;

    self.w[NLEN - 1] = (self.w[NLEN - 1 - m] << n) as Chunk;
    if NLEN >= m + 2 {
        self.w[NLEN - 1] |= (self.w[NLEN - m - 2] >> (BASEBITS - n)) as Chunk;
    }

    for i in (m + 1..NLEN - 1).rev() {
        self.w[i] = ((self.w[i - m] << n) & BMASK) as Chunk | (self.w[i - m - 1] >> (BASEBITS - n)) as Chunk;
    }
    self.w[m] = (self.w[0] << n) & BMASK;
    for i in 0..m {
        self.w[i] = 0;
    }
}
```

This translation maintains the overall structure and logic of the Java function while adapting it to Rust syntax and conventions. It uses the provided `Big` struct and its `w` field, which is an array of `Chunk` type. The function also uses the `BASEBITS` and `BMASK` constants, which are assumed to be defined in the `rom` module or elsewhere in the codebase.

Note that some type casts to `Chunk` have been added to ensure type compatibility, as Rust is more strict about types compared to Java. The function also uses Rust's range syntax for loops and maintains mutability through the `&mut self` parameter.</translated function>Here's the translated Rust function based on the provided Java function, Rust function signature, dependencies, and libraries:
