please translate the given java function to rust according to the rust function signature, rust function dependencies(including function and variable dependencies), and data type declarations and rust function dependency libraries I provide(delimited with XML tags).Please make sure to call the relevant dependencies as much as possible in the translated function Only response the translated function results.

<translated function>
Here's the translated Rust function based on the provided Java function, Rust function signature, dependencies, and data type declarations:

```rust
pub fn norm(&mut self) -> Chunk {
    let mut carry: Chunk = 0;
    for i in 0..NLEN - 1 {
        let d: Chunk = self.x.w[i] + carry;
        self.x.w[i] = d & BMASK;
        carry = d >> BASEBITS;
    }
    self.x.w[NLEN - 1] += carry;
    (self.x.w[NLEN - 1] >> ((8 * MODBYTES) % BASEBITS)) as Chunk
}
```

This Rust implementation closely follows the structure of the original Java function while adhering to Rust's syntax and conventions. It uses the provided dependencies and data type declarations, such as `NLEN`, `BMASK`, `MODBYTES`, and `BASEBITS`. The function operates on `self.x.w`, which is assumed to be the equivalent of the `w` array in the Java version.</translated function>Here's the translated Rust function based on the provided Java function, Rust function signature, dependencies, and data type declarations:
