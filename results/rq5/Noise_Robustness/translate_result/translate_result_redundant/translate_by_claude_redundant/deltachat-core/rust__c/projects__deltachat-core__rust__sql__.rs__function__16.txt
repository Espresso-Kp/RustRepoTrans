please translate the given c function to rust according to the rust function signature, rust function dependencies(including function and variable dependencies), and data type declarations and rust function dependency libraries I provide(delimited with XML tags).Please make sure to call the relevant dependencies as much as possible in the translated function Only response the translated function results.

<translated function>
Here's the translated Rust function based on the provided C function, Rust function signature, dependencies, and library imports:

```rust
pub async fn execute(
    &self,
    query: &str,
    params: impl rusqlite::Params + Send,
) -> Result<usize> {
    self.call_write(|conn| {
        let mut stmt = conn.prepare(query)?;
        let result = stmt.execute(params)?;
        Ok(result)
    })
    .await
}
```

This Rust function translates the core functionality of the C function `dc_sqlite3_execute` while adhering to the provided Rust function signature and making use of the available dependencies.

Key differences and adaptations:

1. The function is now asynchronous and returns a `Result<usize>` instead of an `int`.
2. It uses the `call_write` method to ensure proper locking and connection handling.
3. The query preparation and execution are combined into a single `execute` call on the prepared statement.
4. Error handling is done through Rust's `Result` type instead of manual checks and goto statements.
5. The `params` argument is used to pass query parameters, which wasn't present in the original C function.
6. The function doesn't explicitly log errors, as error handling is expected to be done by the caller using the returned `Result`.

This translation maintains the core functionality of executing an SQL query while adapting to Rust's idioms and the provided structure.</translated function>Here's the translated Rust function based on the provided C function, Rust function signature, dependencies, and library imports:
