pub fn degrade_encryption(&mut self, message_time: i64) {

<translated function>
Here's the translated Rust function based on the provided C function, Rust function signature, dependencies, and data type declarations:

```rust
pub fn degrade_encryption(&mut self, message_time: i64) {
    if self.prefer_encrypt == EncryptPreference::Mutual {
        // Note: The original C code sets a bitfield 'degrade_event',
        // which is not present in the provided Rust struct.
        // If this functionality is needed, you might want to add it to the Rust struct.
    }

    self.prefer_encrypt = EncryptPreference::Reset;
    self.last_seen = message_time;
    // Note: last_seen_autocrypt is not updated as there was no Autocrypt header seen
}
```

This translation maintains the core functionality of the original C function:
1. It checks if the encryption preference is set to Mutual.
2. It sets the encryption preference to Reset.
3. It updates the last_seen timestamp with the provided message_time.

Note that the `degrade_event` bitfield operation from the C function is commented out, as there's no equivalent field in the provided Rust struct. If this functionality is important, you may want to add a similar field to the Rust `Peerstate` struct and implement the bitwise operation.

Also, the null check from the C function is not necessary in Rust, as the function is implemented as a method on `self`, which is guaranteed to be non-null.</translated function>Here's the translated Rust function based on the provided C function, Rust function signature, dependencies, and data type declarations:
