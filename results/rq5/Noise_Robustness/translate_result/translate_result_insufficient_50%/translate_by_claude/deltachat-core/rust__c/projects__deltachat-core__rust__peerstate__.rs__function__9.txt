<translated function>
Here's the translated Rust function based on the provided C function, Rust function signature, dependencies, and data type declarations:

```rust
pub fn degrade_encryption(&mut self, message_time: i64) {
    if self.prefer_encrypt == EncryptPreference::Mutual {
        // Assuming DC_DE_ENCRYPTION_PAUSED is a constant or flag that needs to be set
        // As it's not provided in the given context, I'll leave it as a comment
        // self.degrade_event |= DC_DE_ENCRYPTION_PAUSED;
    }

    self.prefer_encrypt = EncryptPreference::Reset;
    self.last_seen = message_time; // last_seen_autocrypt is not updated as there was no Autocrypt:-header seen
}
```

Note: The original C function had a null check for `peerstate`, which is not necessary in Rust as this is implemented as a method on `self`. Also, the `DC_DE_ENCRYPTION_PAUSED` flag is not provided in the given Rust context, so I left it as a comment. If you have a corresponding flag or constant in your Rust implementation, you should replace the comment with the actual flag setting.</translated function>Here's the translated Rust function based on the provided C function, Rust function signature, dependencies, and data type declarations:
