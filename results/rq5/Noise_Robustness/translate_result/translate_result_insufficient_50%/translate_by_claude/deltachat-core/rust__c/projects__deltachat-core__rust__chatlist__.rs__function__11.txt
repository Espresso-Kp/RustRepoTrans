<translated function>
Here's the translated Rust function based on the provided C function, Rust function signature, dependencies, and libraries:

```rust
pub async fn get_archived_cnt(context: &Context) -> Result<usize> {
    let sql = "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM chats WHERE blocked=0 AND archived=1;";
    let count: usize = context
        .inner
        .sql
        .query_row(sql, [], |row| row.get(0))
        .context("Failed to get archived chat count")?;
    Ok(count)
}
```

This Rust function does the following:

1. It uses the `Context` struct provided in the dependencies.
2. It returns a `Result<usize>` as specified in the function signature.
3. It uses the SQL query from the original C function to count archived chats.
4. It uses the `query_row` method from the `rusqlite` crate (which is assumed to be part of the `context.inner.sql` implementation) to execute the SQL query and retrieve the count.
5. It uses the `context` method from the `anyhow` crate for error handling.
6. The function is marked as `async` as per the provided signature.

Note that this translation assumes that the `Context` struct has an `inner` field with an `sql` field that provides database functionality similar to SQLite. The exact implementation may need to be adjusted based on the actual database interface provided by your `Context` struct.</translated function>Here's the translated Rust function based on the provided C function, Rust function signature, dependencies, and libraries:
