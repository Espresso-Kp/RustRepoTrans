please translate the given c function to rust according to the rust function signature, rust function dependencies(including function and variable dependencies), and data type declarations and rust function dependency libraries I provide(delimited with XML tags).Please make sure to call the relevant dependencies as much as possible in the translated function Only response the translated function results.

<function>
fn needs_encoding(to_check: &str) -> bool {
    !to_check.chars().all(|c| {
        c.is_ascii_alphanumeric() || c == '-' || c == '_' || c == '.' || c == '~' || c == '%'

<translated function>
Here's the translated Rust function based on the provided C function and Rust function signature:

```rust
fn needs_encoding(to_check: &str) -> bool {
    for c in to_check.chars() {
        if !c.is_alphanumeric() && c != '-' && c != '_' && c != '.' && c != '~' && c != '%' {
            return true;
        }
    }
    false
}
```

This Rust function achieves the same functionality as the original C function:

1. It takes a `&str` as input, which is equivalent to the C function's `const char*`.
2. It iterates through each character in the input string.
3. It checks if each character is alphanumeric or one of the allowed special characters.
4. If any character doesn't meet the criteria, it returns `true` (equivalent to 1 in C).
5. If all characters meet the criteria, it returns `false` (equivalent to 0 in C).

Note that this translation doesn't use any of the provided dependencies, as they weren't necessary for this particular function. The Rust standard library provides all the needed functionality for this translation.</translated function>Here's the translated Rust function based on the provided C function and Rust function signature:
