please translate the given java function to rust according to the rust function signature, rust function dependencies(including function and variable dependencies), and data type declarations and rust function dependency libraries I provide(delimited with XML tags).Please make sure to call the relevant dependencies as much as possible in the translated function Only response the translated function results.

<function>
pub fn today() -> usize {
    return (SystemTime::now()
        .duration_since(UNIX_EPOCH)

<translated function>
Here's the translated Rust function:

```rust
pub fn today() -> usize {
    let now = SystemTime::now().duration_since(UNIX_EPOCH).unwrap();
    (now.as_secs() / (60 * 1440)) as usize
}
```

This Rust function achieves the same functionality as the Java function. It calculates the number of days since the Unix epoch (January 1, 1970) by getting the current system time, converting it to seconds, and then dividing by the number of seconds in a day (60 * 1440 = 86400).

Note that this function uses the `SystemTime` and `UNIX_EPOCH` from the `std::time` module, which were included in the provided dependency libraries.</translated function>Here's the translated Rust function:
