please translate the given java function to rust according to the rust function signature, rust function dependencies(including function and variable dependencies), and data type declarations and rust function dependency libraries I provide(delimited with XML tags).Please make sure to call the relevant dependencies as much as possible in the translated function Only response the translated function results.

pub fn norm(&mut self) -> Chunk {

<translated function>
Here's the translated Rust function based on the provided Java function, Rust function signature, dependencies, and libraries:

```rust
pub fn norm(&mut self) -> Chunk {
    let mut carry: Chunk = 0;
    for i in 0..NLEN - 1 {
        let d: Chunk = self.w[i] + carry;
        self.w[i] = d & ((1 << BASEBITS) - 1);
        carry = d >> BASEBITS;
    }
    self.w[NLEN - 1] = self.w[NLEN - 1] + carry;
    (self.w[NLEN - 1] >> ((8 * MODBYTES) % BASEBITS)) as Chunk
}
```

This translation maintains the logic of the original Java function while adapting it to Rust syntax and conventions. It uses the provided constants and types, such as `NLEN`, `MODBYTES`, `BASEBITS`, and `Chunk`. The function mutates `self` and returns a `Chunk` as specified in the function signature.</translated function>Here's the translated Rust function based on the provided Java function, Rust function signature, dependencies, and libraries:
