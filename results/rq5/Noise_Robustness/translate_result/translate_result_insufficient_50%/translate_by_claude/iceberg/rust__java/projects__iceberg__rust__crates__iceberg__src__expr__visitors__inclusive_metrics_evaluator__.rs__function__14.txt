please translate the given java function to rust according to the rust function signature, rust function dependencies(including function and variable dependencies), and data type declarations and rust function dependency libraries I provide(delimited with XML tags).Please make sure to call the relevant dependencies as much as possible in the translated function Only response the translated function results.

<translated function>
Here's the translated Rust function based on the provided Java function, Rust function signature, dependencies, and libraries:

```rust
fn not_nan(
    &mut self,
    reference: &BoundReference,
    _predicate: &BoundPredicate,
) -> crate::Result<bool> {
    let id = reference.field().field_id();

    if self.contains_nans_only(id) {
        ROWS_CANNOT_MATCH
    } else {
        ROWS_MIGHT_MATCH
    }
}
```

This translation makes the following adjustments:

1. The function name is changed from `notNaN` to `not_nan` to follow Rust naming conventions.
2. The generic type `<T>` is removed as it's not needed in the Rust version.
3. The `BoundReference<T>` is changed to `&BoundReference` as per the Rust function signature.
4. The `fieldId()` method is replaced with `field().field_id()`, assuming that `field()` returns a reference to a `NestedField` which has a `field_id()` method.
5. Instead of using a `mayContainNulls.get(id)` check, we use the provided `contains_nans_only(id)` method, which seems to be the closest equivalent based on the given dependencies.
6. The `Boolean` return type is changed to `crate::Result<bool>` as per the Rust function signature.
7. We use the provided constants `ROWS_CANNOT_MATCH` and `ROWS_MIGHT_MATCH` for the return values.

This translation assumes that the `self` in the Rust version has methods equivalent to those used in the Java version, adapted to Rust's conventions and the provided dependencies.</translated function>Here's the translated Rust function based on the provided Java function, Rust function signature, dependencies, and libraries:
