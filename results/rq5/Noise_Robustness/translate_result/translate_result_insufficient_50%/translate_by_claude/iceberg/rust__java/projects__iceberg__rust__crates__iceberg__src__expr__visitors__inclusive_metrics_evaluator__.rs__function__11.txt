please translate the given java function to rust according to the rust function signature, rust function dependencies(including function and variable dependencies), and data type declarations and rust function dependency libraries I provide(delimited with XML tags).Please make sure to call the relevant dependencies as much as possible in the translated function Only response the translated function results.

<translated function>
Here's the translated Rust function based on the provided Java function, Rust function signature, dependencies, and libraries:

```rust
fn is_null(
    &mut self,
    reference: &BoundReference,
    _predicate: &BoundPredicate,
) -> crate::Result<bool> {
    let id = reference.field.id();

    // Check if the column has value counts
    if let Some(value_count) = self.data_file.value_counts.get(&id) {
        // Check if there are column statistics
        if let Some(col_stats) = self.data_file.column_stats.get(&id) {
            if !col_stats.is_empty() && col_stats.null_count() == 0 {
                // There are stats and no values are null => all values are non-null
                return ROWS_CANNOT_MATCH;
            }
        }
        // The column is present, but we can't determine if it has null values
        ROWS_MIGHT_MATCH
    } else {
        // The column is not present and is all nulls
        ROWS_MIGHT_MATCH
    }
}
```

This translation makes the following assumptions and adaptations:

1. The `BoundReference` struct in Rust contains a `field` member of type `NestedFieldRef`, which has an `id()` method.
2. The `DataFile` struct (accessed via `self.data_file`) has `value_counts` and `column_stats` fields, which are likely `HashMap`s with keys of the same type as the field ID.
3. The column statistics (`col_stats`) have an `is_empty()` method and a `null_count()` method.
4. The `ROWS_MIGHT_MATCH` and `ROWS_CANNOT_MATCH` constants are used as in the original Java code.

Please note that this translation may need further adjustments based on the exact implementation details of the Rust types and structures that weren't provided in the given context.</translated function>Here's the translated Rust function based on the provided Java function, Rust function signature, dependencies, and libraries:
