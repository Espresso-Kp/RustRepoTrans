please translate the given python function to rust according to the rust function signature, rust function dependencies(including function and variable dependencies), and data type declarations and rust function dependency libraries I provide(delimited with XML tags).Please make sure to call the relevant dependencies as much as possible in the translated function Only response the translated function results.

<translated function>
Here's the translated Rust function based on the provided Python function, Rust function signature, dependencies, and libraries:

```rust
fn not_nan(
    &mut self,
    reference: &BoundReference,
    _predicate: &BoundPredicate,
) -> crate::Result<bool> {
    let field_id = reference.field.id;

    if self.contains_nans_only(field_id) {
        ROWS_CANNOT_MATCH
    } else {
        Ok(true)
    }
}
```

Note that I made the following assumptions and adaptations:

1. The `_contains_nans_only` method from the Python version is assumed to be implemented as `contains_nans_only` in the Rust version of `InclusiveMetricsEvaluator`.

2. The `ROWS_MIGHT_MATCH` constant from the Python version is replaced with `Ok(true)` in the Rust version, as the function signature requires a `Result<bool>`.

3. The `term.ref().field.field_id` from the Python version is adapted to `reference.field.id` in the Rust version, based on the provided `BoundReference` struct.

4. The `_predicate` parameter is unused in this function, which matches the Python version where `term` is the only used parameter.

5. The function is implemented as a method of `InclusiveMetricsEvaluator`, as implied by the `&mut self` in the function signature.

This translation maintains the logic of the original Python function while adapting it to the provided Rust function signature and dependencies.</translated function>Here's the translated Rust function based on the provided Python function, Rust function signature, dependencies, and libraries:
