please translate the given python function to rust according to the rust function signature, rust function dependencies(including function and variable dependencies), and data type declarations and rust function dependency libraries I provide(delimited with XML tags).Please make sure to call the relevant dependencies as much as possible in the translated function Only response the translated function results.

<translated function>
Here's the translated Rust function based on the provided Python function, Rust function signature, dependencies, and data type declarations:

pub fn location(&self) -> &str {
    &self.path[..self.relative_path_pos]
}

This Rust function assumes that the `location` method is implemented for either the `OutputFile` or `InputFile` struct, as both have the same relevant fields (`path` and `relative_path_pos`). The function returns a string slice (&str) containing the fully-qualified location of the file, which is the substring of `path` from the beginning up to `relative_path_pos`.</translated function>Here's the translated Rust function based on the provided Python function, Rust function signature, dependencies, and data type declarations:
