please translate the given python function to rust according to the rust function signature, rust function dependencies(including function and variable dependencies), and data type declarations and rust function dependency libraries I provide(delimited with XML tags).Please make sure to call the relevant dependencies as much as possible in the translated function Only response the translated function results.

<translated function>
Here's the translated Rust function based on the provided information:

```rust
fn remove(&mut self, k: &Key) {
    // Remove the key from the records HashMap
    self.records.remove(k);

    // Remove the key from the providers HashMap
    self.providers.remove(k);

    // Remove any provider records associated with this key from the provided HashSet
    self.provided.retain(|record| record.key != *k);
}
```

This translation assumes that the `Key` type is comparable and hashable. The function removes the given key from both the `records` and `providers` HashMaps, and also removes any provider records associated with this key from the `provided` HashSet.

Note that this translation differs somewhat from the original Python function due to the different function signature and the provided Rust struct definition. The Rust version operates on a `Key` directly, rather than a `SwarmConn`, and it updates multiple collections within the `MemoryStore` struct.</translated function>Here's the translated Rust function based on the provided information:
