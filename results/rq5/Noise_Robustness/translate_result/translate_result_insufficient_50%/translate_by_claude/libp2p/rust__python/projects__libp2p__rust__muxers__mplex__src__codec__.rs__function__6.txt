please translate the given python function to rust according to the rust function signature, rust function dependencies(including function and variable dependencies), and data type declarations and rust function dependency libraries I provide(delimited with XML tags).Please make sure to call the relevant dependencies as much as possible in the translated function Only response the translated function results.

<translated function>
Here's the translated Rust function based on the provided information:

```rust
pub(crate) fn next(mut self) -> Self {
    self.num += 1;
    self
}
```

This Rust function is a simplified version of the Python function, adapted to the Rust struct and function signature provided. It increments the `num` field of the `LocalStreamId` struct and returns the modified instance.

Note that this translation makes some assumptions:
1. The `channel_id` in the Python version corresponds to the `num` field in the Rust `LocalStreamId` struct.
2. The Rust version uses `Self` instead of creating a new instance, as it's more idiomatic in Rust to modify the existing instance.
3. The `role` field is not modified, as there's no equivalent operation in the Python version.

The function uses the `mut self` parameter to allow modification of the struct instance, which is then returned as per the function signature.</translated function>Here's the translated Rust function based on the provided information:
