please translate the given c function to rust according to the rust function signature, rust function realted variable, functions, and data type declarations and rust function dependency libraries I provide(delimited with XML tags). Only response the translated function results.

<translated function>
Here is the Rust version of your C function:

```rust
pub fn get_i64(&self, key: Param) -> Option<i64> {
    match self.get(key) {
        None => None,
        Some(s) => match s.parse::<i64>() {
            Err(_) => None,
            Ok(number) => Some(number),
        },
    }
}
```
The Rust function is both safe and idiomatic, unlike the C function, and avoids errors by returning `Option<i64>`. If the function could not find the key in the map, or if the string could not be converted to `i64`, it will return `None`.
The function signature indicates that it is a public member function in a struct, it doesn't require to check `NULL` as opposed to `NULL` comparisons in C, since Rust doesn't have `NULL`.
The `self.get(key)` function searches for the `key` in `self.inner` (which is a `BTreeMap`) and returns the value if it exists as a string slice.
The `parse::<i64>()` function converts the string into an `i64` if it's successful. If it fails (for example, if the string contains non-digit characters), it returns an error.

It's important to note that in the Rust version, no dynamic memory is freed, as the language's memory management is automatic, further reducing the chance of error. The C function frees 'str', but the equivalent Rust method 'get()' returns a borrowed reference that doesn't need to be freed.</translated function>Here is the Rust version of your C function:
