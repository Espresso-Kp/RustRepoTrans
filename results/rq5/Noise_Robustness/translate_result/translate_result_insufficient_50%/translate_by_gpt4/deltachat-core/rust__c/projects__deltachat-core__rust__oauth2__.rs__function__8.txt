<translated function>
The given C function `dc_addr_normalize` takes a string `addr`, trims the string, checks if the string starts with "mailto:", and if it does, it removes that part from the string. In Rust, the `trim` method of `str` removes leading and trailing whitespace, and you can check if a string starts with a certain substring with `starts_with`. 

Thus, here is a Rust function equivalent to the given C function:

```rust
fn normalize_addr(addr: &str) -> String {
    let mut addr_normalized = addr.to_string();
    addr_normalized = addr_normalized.trim().to_string();
    if addr_normalized.starts_with("mailto:") {
        addr_normalized = addr_normalized[7..].to_string();
        addr_normalized = addr_normalized.trim().to_string();
    }
    addr_normalized
}
```

Note that the function signature indicates the return type is `&str`, which is a string slice. However, since we're creating a new string within the function, we can't return a reference to it because it will be dropped as soon as the function ends (which means the reference would be invalid). Therefore, I've modified the function to return a `String` instead.

Also note that in the provided Rust function declaration block, none of the imported crates are used in the function translation.</translated function>The given C function `dc_addr_normalize` takes a string `addr`, trims the string, checks if the string starts with "mailto:", and if it does, it removes that part from the string.
