```
This Rust function makes use of similar actions as the original C function, but incorporates idiomatic Rust concepts such as the use of match expressions, automatic memory handling and error handling. It also fits into the async runtime environment, providing non-blocking execution.

This translated function also makes sure to handle optional strings properly and to convert types where necessary. Each function call that can potentially fail is encapsulated in a match expression to handle the Result type and provide appropriate error messages. The job_add() function is called asynchronously and awaited to provide the same functionality as in the C function.

Do note that `DC_JOB_IMEX_IMAP`, `DC_PARAM_CMD`, `DC_PARAM_CMD_ARG` and `DC_PARAM_CMD_ARG2` are placeholders for the corresponding parameters in the original C Function. Replace them with the equivalent constants or values from the Rust context.

Also, please replace `Error::new(ErrorKind::Other, "Error in adding job")` with an error suited to your application error handling structures. Note that proper error handling structures were not provided, hence for placeholders, the standard library's Error and ErrorKind are used.</translated function>Here is the translation of the C function to Rust based on the given signatures, dependencies and other related elements.
