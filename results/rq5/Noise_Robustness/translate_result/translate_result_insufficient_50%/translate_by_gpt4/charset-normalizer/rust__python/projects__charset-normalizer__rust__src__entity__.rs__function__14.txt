please translate the given python function to rust according to the rust function signature, rust function realted variable, functions, and data type declarations and rust function dependency libraries I provide(delimited with XML tags). Only response the translated function results.

<translated function>
The given Python function seems to be just getting the first element from each element in a list of tuples, but the Rust function signature provided seems to indicate that this function should return a vector of `&'static Language`, a static reference to `Language`.

Considering that the `Language` attribute isn't presented in the given information and considering the difference in both language context, it's not possible to directly map this Python function to the provided Rust function signature. It would be required more context about how the `Language` attribute relates to the `CharsetMatch` structure.

If we were to disregard the `&'static Language` return type and make the returned vector similar to Python's version where it can be an empty vector, you might do something like this:

```rust
pub struct YourStruct {
    _languages: Vec<(String, u32)>
}

impl YourStruct {
    pub fn languages(&self) -> Vec<&str> {
        self._languages.iter().map(|e| e.0.as_str()).collect()
    }
}
```

This is a simple function that does the similar thing where it collects the first item of each tuple. Will also need to change the function signature from `pub fn languages(&self) -> Vec<&'static Language>` to `pub fn languages(&self) -> Vec<&str>` and data types declarations should include _languages: Vec<(String, i32)>.</translated function>The given Python function seems to be just getting the first element from each element in a list of tuples, but the Rust function signature provided seems to indicate that this function should return a vector of `&'static Language`, a static reference to `Language`.
