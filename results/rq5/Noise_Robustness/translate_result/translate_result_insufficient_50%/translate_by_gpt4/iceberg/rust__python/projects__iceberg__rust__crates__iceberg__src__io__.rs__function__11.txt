Async I/O functions in Rust can be a bit tricky due to a slightly different model compared to synchronous I/O in Python, but here is an equivalent of your function in Rust using `tokio::fs::File` and `tokio`'s AsyncReadExt trait to read asynchronously from the file.

```rust
use tokio::io::AsyncReadExt;
use bytes::Bytes;

impl InputFile {
    pub async fn read(&self, range: Range<u64>) -> Result<Bytes, Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
        let mut file = File::open(&self.path).await?;
        let mut buffer = vec![0; range.end as usize];
        file.read_exact(&mut buffer).await?;
        let data = Bytes::from(buffer);
        Ok(data)
    }
}
```

This function will read file from the specified bytes range, converting the data into `Bytes` which is an efficient, shareable, immutable buffer of bytes. 

Please note:
- Rust's `AsyncReadExt` trait offers a `read_exact` method which will read the exact number of bytes in the buffer or return an error.
- The `Box<dyn std::error::Error>` is a general Error type in Rust. If you have a specific Error type defined in your crate, you can replace this with your type.
- The use of `tokio::fs::File` and `tokio::io::AsyncReadExt` params requires `'tokio'` feature to be enabled for `tokio`. You should include `tokio = { version = "1", features = ["full"] }` in your `Cargo.toml`.
- In Rust, you would usually use the `?` operator to do error handling, this means "if this operation fails, return the error". This greatly simplifies the code compared to using exceptions in Python. In Rust, returning an error usually means that the function is done and nothing more will be executed.
- The `Bytes` type is an efficient, shareable, immutable buffer of bytes which is ideal for I/O operations.
- This solution doesn't include checking for concurrent reading operations. If you need to handle multiple readers, you might want to use a mutex or similar approach.
- It is the responsibility of the caller to ensure that the range is correct.</translated function>Async I/O functions in Rust can be a bit tricky due to a slightly different model compared to synchronous I/O in Python, but here is an equivalent of your function in Rust using `tokio::fs::File` and `tokio`'s AsyncReadExt trait to read asynchronously from the file.
