<translated function>
Based on the provided Python function and Rust-related variable, functions, and datatype declarations, the translated Rust function could be as follows:

```rust
pub async fn commit(mut self, catalog: &impl Catalog) -> Result<Table> {
    self.requirements = vec![TableRequirement::AssertCreate];
    self.table._do_commit(
        updates=self.updates,
        requirements=self.requirements,
    )?;
    Ok(self.table.clone())
}
```
However, there are few important things to notes and a lot of details are missing:

1. The `_do_commit` method doesn't seem to exist on the Table struct in Rust, you might need to properly define its signature and implementation.

2. The `clone()` method is used on self.table to return an owned Table. If Table does not implement Clone, you will need to add this.

3. The `TableRequirement::AssertCreate` might not be exist in your Crate, You should replace it with Valid value of enum `TableRequirement`.

Please replace these parts with your actual code logic. This translation assumes that the `_do_commit` function is doing something similar to the Python version. Perhaps, self.table._do_commit should be replaced with an equivalent Rust logic. So, you should revise it according to your business logic.</translated function>Based on the provided Python function and Rust-related variable, functions, and datatype declarations, the translated Rust function could be as follows:
