<function>
pub async fn close(self) -> Result<()> {
        let data = self.avro_writer.into_inner()?;
        let mut writer = self.output_file.writer().await?;

<translated function>
In Rust, functions do not throw exceptions like in Java. Instead, Result enum is used to represent either success (Ok) or failure (Err). 

It's also noteworthy that Rust doesn't have direct equivalent of Java's null. The Option Enum is often used in similar situations. 

Another unique characteristic of Rust is its ownership model. Variables are immutable by default and when a variable is moved into a function, the caller gives up the ownership and cannot use it anymore.

Accounting for these differences, the given Java function can be rewritten in Rust as below:

<rust function>
pub async fn close(&mut self) -> Result<(), Error> {
    match self.writer() {
        Ok(mut writer) => {
            writer.close().await?;
            self.footer = Some(writer.get_footer().await?);
        },
        _ => return Err(Error::new(ErrorKind::Other, "Writer not defined")),
    }
    Ok(())
}
</rust function>

The translation is not exact as several assumptions are made. This Rust function is assuming the writer function closes the file and returns a Result. When called, if it is Ok(writer), it will close the writer and set the footer to Some value returned by writer.get_footer(). If anything fails and returns Err, it will simply propagate that error back to the caller. If the writer is not defined, it fails with an error.</translated function>In Rust, functions do not throw exceptions like in Java.
