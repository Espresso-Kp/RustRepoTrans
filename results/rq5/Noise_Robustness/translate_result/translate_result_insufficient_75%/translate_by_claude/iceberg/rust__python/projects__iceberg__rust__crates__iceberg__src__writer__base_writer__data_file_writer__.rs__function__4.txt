please translate the given python function to rust according to the rust function signature, rust function dependencies(including function and variable dependencies), and data type declarations and rust function dependency libraries I provide(delimited with XML tags).Please make sure to call the relevant dependencies as much as possible in the translated function Only response the translated function results.

<translated function>
Here's the translated Rust function based on the provided Python function, Rust function signature, dependencies, and libraries:

```rust
async fn write(&mut self, batch: RecordBatch) -> Result<()> {
    self.inner_writer.as_mut().unwrap().write(&batch).await
}
```

This translation takes into account the following:

1. The function signature matches the provided Rust signature, including the `async` keyword and `Result<()>` return type.
2. The `self` parameter is passed as `&mut self` to allow for mutable access to the struct's fields.
3. Instead of using an `encoder` and `value` as in the Python version, the Rust function takes a `RecordBatch` as input.
4. The function calls the `write` method on `inner_writer`, which is assumed to be an `Option<B::R>` where `B` is a type that implements `FileWriterBuilder`.
5. The `unwrap()` method is used to access the inner value of the `Option`, and `as_mut()` is called to get a mutable reference.
6. The `await` keyword is used to handle the asynchronous nature of the `write` operation.

This translation assumes that the `inner_writer` field contains the actual writer implementation, which is consistent with the provided `DataFileWriter` struct definition.</translated function>Here's the translated Rust function based on the provided Python function, Rust function signature, dependencies, and libraries:
