please translate the given python function to rust according to the rust function signature, rust function dependencies(including function and variable dependencies), and data type declarations and rust function dependency libraries I provide(delimited with XML tags).Please make sure to call the relevant dependencies as much as possible in the translated function Only response the translated function results.

<translated function>
Here's the translated Rust function based on the provided Python function, Rust function signature, dependencies, and libraries:

```rust
fn schema(&self) -> ArrowSchemaRef {
    self.schema.clone()
}
```

This translation assumes that the `IcebergTableProvider` struct already has a `schema` field of type `ArrowSchemaRef`, which is a reference-counted Arrow schema. The function simply returns a clone of this schema.

The translation differs from the original Python function because the Rust struct appears to store the schema directly, rather than having to search for it in a collection of schemas. The `clone()` method is used to return a new reference to the same schema, as `ArrowSchemaRef` is likely an `Arc<Schema>` (atomically reference-counted Schema).</translated function>Here's the translated Rust function based on the provided Python function, Rust function signature, dependencies, and libraries:
