please translate the given java function to rust according to the rust function signature, rust function dependencies(including function and variable dependencies), and data type declarations and rust function dependency libraries I provide(delimited with XML tags).Please make sure to call the relevant dependencies as much as possible in the translated function Only response the translated function results.

<translated function>
Here's the translated Rust function based on the provided Java function, Rust function signature, dependencies, and data type declarations:

```rust
fn not_nan(
    &mut self,
    reference: &BoundReference,
    _predicate: &BoundPredicate,
) -> crate::Result<bool> {
    let field_id = reference.field().id;

    if self.contains_nans_only(field_id) {
        ROWS_CANNOT_MATCH
    } else {
        ROWS_MIGHT_MATCH
    }
}
```

This translation makes the following adjustments:

1. The function name is changed from `notNaN` to `not_nan` to follow Rust naming conventions.
2. The generic type `<T>` is removed as it's not needed in the Rust version.
3. Instead of using `mayContainNulls.get(id)`, we use the provided `contains_nans_only` method.
4. The `fieldId()` method call on `ref` is replaced with accessing the `id` field of the `NestedField` returned by the `field()` method of `BoundReference`.
5. The return type is changed to `crate::Result<bool>` as specified in the Rust function signature.
6. The constants `ROWS_CANNOT_MATCH` and `ROWS_MIGHT_MATCH` are used directly, as they are already defined as `crate::Result<bool>`.

This translation maintains the logic of the original Java function while adapting it to the provided Rust structure and dependencies.</translated function>Here's the translated Rust function based on the provided Java function, Rust function signature, dependencies, and data type declarations:
