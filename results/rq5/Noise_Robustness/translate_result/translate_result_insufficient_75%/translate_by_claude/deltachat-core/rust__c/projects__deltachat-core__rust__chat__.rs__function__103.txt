<translated function>
Here's the translated Rust function based on the provided C function, Rust function signature, dependencies, and libraries:

```rust
pub async fn is_contact_in_chat(
    context: &Context,
    chat_id: ChatId,
    contact_id: ContactId,
) -> Result<bool> {
    // This function works for group and normal chats, however, it is more useful for group chats.
    // DC_CONTACT_ID_SELF may be used to check if the user itself is in a group chat
    // (DC_CONTACT_ID_SELF is not added to normal chats)

    let sql = "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM chats_contacts WHERE chat_id=? AND contact_id=?;";
    let params = rusqlite::params![chat_id.0, contact_id.0];

    context.inner.sql.exists(sql, params).await
}
```

This translation makes the following changes and assumptions:

1. The function is now asynchronous, as indicated by the `async` keyword and `Result<bool>` return type.

2. We use the `Context` struct directly, assuming it contains the necessary SQL functionality.

3. Instead of manually preparing statements and handling cleanup, we use the `exists` method from the `Sql` struct, which is part of the `Context`.

4. The `chat_id` and `contact_id` are assumed to be of types `ChatId` and `ContactId` respectively, which likely wrap `u32` values.

5. We use `rusqlite::params!` macro to create the parameter list for the SQL query.

6. Error handling is implicit in the `Result<bool>` return type, which will propagate any errors that occur during the database query.

7. The original C function's manual cleanup and error checking are not necessary in Rust due to its ownership system and the `?` operator for error propagation.

This translation assumes that the `exists` method on the `Sql` struct handles the actual database query and returns a `Result<bool>` indicating whether the count is greater than zero.</translated function>Here's the translated Rust function based on the provided C function, Rust function signature, dependencies, and libraries:
