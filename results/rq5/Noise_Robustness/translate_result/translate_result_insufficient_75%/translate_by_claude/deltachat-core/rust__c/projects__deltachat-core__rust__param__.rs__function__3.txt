please translate the given c function to rust according to the rust function signature, rust function dependencies(including function and variable dependencies), and data type declarations and rust function dependency libraries I provide(delimited with XML tags).Please make sure to call the relevant dependencies as much as possible in the translated function Only response the translated function results.

<translated function>
Here's the translated Rust function based on the provided C function, Rust function signature, dependencies, and libraries:

pub fn new() -> Self {
    Params {
        inner: BTreeMap::new(),
    }
}

Note that the Rust implementation is significantly different from the C version due to the following reasons:

1. Rust uses a different memory management model, so we don't need to manually allocate memory.
2. The provided Rust struct `Params` already contains a `BTreeMap`, which serves a similar purpose to the C struct's members.
3. Rust doesn't use `NULL` or `exit()` in the same way as C, so error handling would be different if needed.
4. The `packed` field from the C struct is not present in the Rust struct, so it's not included in the translation.

This implementation creates a new `Params` struct with an empty `BTreeMap`, which is equivalent to initializing the struct with default values.</translated function>Here's the translated Rust function based on the provided C function, Rust function signature, dependencies, and libraries:
