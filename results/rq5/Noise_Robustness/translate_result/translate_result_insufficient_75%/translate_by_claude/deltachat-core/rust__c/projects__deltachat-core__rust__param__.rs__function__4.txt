please translate the given c function to rust according to the rust function signature, rust function dependencies(including function and variable dependencies), and data type declarations and rust function dependency libraries I provide(delimited with XML tags).Please make sure to call the relevant dependencies as much as possible in the translated function Only response the translated function results.

<translated function>
Here's the translated Rust function based on the provided C function, Rust function signature, dependencies, and libraries:

```rust
pub fn get(&self, key: Param) -> Option<&str> {
    self.inner.get(&key).map(|s| s.as_str())
}
```

This Rust implementation is much simpler than the original C function due to the different data structures and idioms used in Rust. The `Params` struct is using a `BTreeMap` to store key-value pairs, which allows for a straightforward lookup.

The function does the following:
1. It uses the `get` method of `BTreeMap` to look up the value associated with the given `key`.
2. If a value is found, it uses `map` to convert the `String` reference to a `&str`.
3. The function returns `None` if the key is not found, which matches the `Option<&str>` return type in the function signature.

This implementation assumes that the `Param` type implements the necessary traits to be used as a key in a `BTreeMap` (likely `Ord`, `PartialOrd`, `Eq`, and `PartialEq`).

Note that this implementation doesn't include the default value functionality present in the C version. If that's required, you would need to modify the function signature and implementation accordingly.</translated function>Here's the translated Rust function based on the provided C function, Rust function signature, dependencies, and libraries:
