please translate the given c function to rust according to the rust function signature, rust function dependencies(including function and variable dependencies), and data type declarations and rust function dependency libraries I provide(delimited with XML tags).Please make sure to call the relevant dependencies as much as possible in the translated function Only response the translated function results.

<translated function>
Here's the translated Rust function based on the provided C function and Rust function signature:

```rust
fn normalize_addr(addr: &str) -> &str {
    let mut addr_normalized = addr.trim().to_string();
    if addr_normalized.starts_with("mailto:") {
        addr_normalized = addr_normalized[7..].trim().to_string();
    }
    Box::leak(addr_normalized.into_boxed_str())
}
```

Note that this translation has some important differences from the original C function:

1. Instead of using `dc_strdup`, we're working directly with Rust strings.
2. The `trim` operation is done using Rust's `trim()` method.
3. We use Rust's `starts_with` method to check for the "mailto:" prefix.
4. To return a `&str` that lives as long as the program (to match the function signature), we use `Box::leak`. This creates a memory leak, which is generally not recommended in Rust. A better approach would be to change the function signature to return a `String` instead.

Also, note that this function doesn't use any of the provided dependencies in the Rust function dependency libraries. The original C function used some custom functions like `dc_strdup` and `dc_trim`, which aren't available in the Rust standard library or the provided dependencies.</translated function>Here's the translated Rust function based on the provided C function and Rust function signature:
