<translated function>
Here's the translated Rust function based on the provided C function, Rust function signature, dependencies, and libraries:

```rust
pub(crate) fn create_smeared_timestamp(context: &Context) -> i64 {
    let now = time();
    let ret = now;
    {
        let mut smeared_timestamp = context.inner.smeared_timestamp.write().unwrap();
        *smeared_timestamp = ret;
    }
    ret
}
```

This Rust implementation follows the provided function signature and makes use of the available dependencies. Here are the key changes and considerations:

1. The `time()` function is used instead of `time(NULL)` to get the current timestamp.
2. The `SMEAR_LOCK` and `SMEAR_UNLOCK` macros are replaced with Rust's synchronization primitives. In this case, we use a write lock on the `smeared_timestamp` field of the `InnerContext`.
3. The `last_smeared_timestamp` is updated using the `smeared_timestamp` field of the `InnerContext`, which is accessed through the `Context` struct.
4. The function returns an `i64` as specified in the Rust function signature, which is compatible with the `time_t` type used in the C function.

This implementation maintains the functionality of the original C function while adhering to Rust's ownership and borrowing rules, and using the provided Context structure.</translated function>Here's the translated Rust function based on the provided C function, Rust function signature, dependencies, and libraries:
