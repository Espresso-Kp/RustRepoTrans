Based on the code provided, it looks like you want to extract the public key from an RSA key pair in Rust. Here is one possible implementation, using the `rust-openssl` crate:

```Rust
pub fn public(&self) -> PublicKey {
    let public_key = self.0.public_key().expect("Failed to get public key");
    let public_key_pem = public_key.public_key_to_pem().expect("Failed to convert public key to PEM");
    PublicKey(public_key_pem)
}
```
In this implementation, the `public()` function extracts the public key from the internal `RsaKeyPair` (which is wrapped in an `Arc` for shared ownership). It then converts this public key to a PEM-formatted byte vector using `public_key_to_pem()`. 

Please note that I'm assuming `PublicKey(Vec<u8>)` is designed to take a byte vector in PEM format. If this isn't the case, you may need to adjust the code.

For this solution, you should also include a dependency on the `rust-openssl` crate in your Cargo.toml:

```Rust
[dependencies]
openssl = "0.10"
```

As an additional note, this implementation will cause a panic if the RSA key pair doesn't have a public key or if the conversion to PEM fails. You may want to replace `expect()` with proper error handling if these aren't acceptable program termination conditions.</translated function>Based on the code provided, it looks like you want to extract the public key from an RSA key pair in Rust.
