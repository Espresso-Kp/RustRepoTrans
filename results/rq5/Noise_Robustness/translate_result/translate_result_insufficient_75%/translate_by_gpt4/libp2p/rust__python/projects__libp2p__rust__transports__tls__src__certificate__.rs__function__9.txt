please translate the given python function to rust according to the rust function signature, rust function realted variable, functions, and data type declarations and rust function dependency libraries I provide(delimited with XML tags). Only response the translated function results.

<translated function>
Based on the information you've provided, the python function could be translated to something like:

```rust
pub fn calculate_peer_id(&self) -> PeerId {
    PeerId::from(self.public_key)
}
```

However, I assume that you might have already tried similar translation and it didn't work or you have a special `PeerId` type that is not directly constructible from a public key.

A more complex translation given your data types could look like this:

```rust
pub fn calculate_peer_id(&self) -> PeerId {
    PeerId::from_pubkey(self.extension.public_key.clone())
}
```

Please note that you might have to instantiate `PeerId` differently or change the function to suit your needs, as there is no info on how the `PeerId` and other types are declared and used. The essential idea is to access the public key from the `extension` field of your struct.</translated function>Based on the information you've provided, the python function could be translated to something like:
