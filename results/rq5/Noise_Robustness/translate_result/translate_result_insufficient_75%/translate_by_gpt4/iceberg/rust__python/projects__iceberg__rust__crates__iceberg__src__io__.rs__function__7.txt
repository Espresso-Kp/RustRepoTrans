<translated function>
Based on the given Python code and Rust Environment, the translated Rust code could resemble something like this:

```rust
pub async fn delete(&self, path: impl AsRef<str>) -> Result<()> {
    let path = path.as_ref();
    let (op, path) = self.create_operator(path)?;
    op.delete(path).await?;
    Ok(())
}
```

In this function:

1. The file location is converted to a string.
2. The `create_operator` function is called to establish the appropriate file system (`Operator`) and apply any adjustments to the path.
3. The `delete` method on the chosen `Operator` is invoked to delete the file.

This function is asynchronous and should be invoked with `.await`, as in `file_io.delete("file:/path/to/file").await?;`.

This function may return an error from `create_operator` or `delete`; such an error is propagated up to the caller by the `?` operator.

Disclaimers:
- Because the `create_operator` function has not been provided in the question and might have some side effects or require additional context, this solution cannot be guaranteed to fit in the larger context of the project.
- The Python function included some specific exception types (`FileNotFoundError`, `PermissionError`) and might treat the `fs.delete_file(path)` call's exceptions differently. The Rust solution merely propagates any errors up for the caller to handle.</translated function>Based on the given Python code and Rust Environment, the translated Rust code could resemble something like this:
