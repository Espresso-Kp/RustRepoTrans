<translated function>
In Rust, you can achieve the functionality of the provided C function with the method from the struct as follows:

```rust
impl Chat {
    pub fn get_name(&self) -> &str {
        &self.name
    }
}
```

Because Rust is a statically typed safe language, the possibility of a null pointer is eliminated. Therefore, checks of null pointers that were in the C function are not required here. 

If the `name` field of the struct `Chat` is always initialized (even as an empty string), it is safe to return a reference to `name` from the `get_name()` function. You must ensure that the `name` field is always valid throughout the lifetime of the `Chat` object, else you may end up with a dangling reference. 

Also, note that returning `&str` means that the client code can't modify `name` through this reference (since `&str` is an immutable reference), hence enforcing encapsulation. If you need to allow modifications, you may need to return a mutable reference using `&mut str` (and change the function itself to a `&mut self` method).</translated function>In Rust, you can achieve the functionality of the provided C function with the method from the struct as follows:
