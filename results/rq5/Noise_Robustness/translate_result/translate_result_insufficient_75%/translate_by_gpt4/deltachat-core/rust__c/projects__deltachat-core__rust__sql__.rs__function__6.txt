<translated function>
Here is your translated C function to Rust:

```rust
use std::sync::Arc;

impl Sql {
    async fn close(&self) {
        let mut pool = self.pool.write().await;
        if let Some(pool) = pool.take() {
            pool.close().await;
        }
    }
}
```

The rust async function here uses the async lock to make it thread safe. If the `pool` field in the `Sql` struct, which denotes the SQL connection pool, is `Some` (i.e., it is not `None`, meaning the database is open), it calls the `close` method on `pool` to close the database connection and then sets the `pool` field to `None`, denoting that the database is now closed.

This function does not return a result, matching the void return type of your C function.

Note: Here I assume that your `Pool` struct or whatever struct you are using for the connection pool have a `close` method or similar to close the connection. Also assuming, your `Pool` object is `Send` so it can be used across threads. Please adapt accordingly to your specific setup.</translated function>Here is your translated C function to Rust:
