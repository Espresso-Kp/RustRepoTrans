please translate the given java function to rust according to the rust function signature, rust function realted variable, functions, and data type declarations and rust function dependency libraries I provide(delimited with XML tags). Only response the translated function results.

<translated function>
Here is the translated Rust function:
```rust
pub fn set(&mut self, i: usize, x: Chunk) {
    self.w[i] = x;
}
```
Note that I've assumed that `NLEN` is a constant that defines the length of the `w` array, and that `Chunk` is a type that can be assigned to the `w` array. If that's not the case, please let me know and I'll adjust the translation accordingly.</translated function>Here is the translated Rust function:
