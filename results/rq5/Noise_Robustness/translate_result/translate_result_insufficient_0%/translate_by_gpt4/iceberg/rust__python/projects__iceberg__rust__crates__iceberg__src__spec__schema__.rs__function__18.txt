<translated function>
In the given Python function, it appears that 'fields' are attributes of the object and 'StructType' is a constructor that takes these fields as arguments.

The equivalent in Rust would involve creating a new instance of the StructType with the fields argument.

Here is the equivalent Rust function:

```rust
pub fn as_struct(&self) -> StructType {
  StructType::new(self.fields.clone())
}
```

Note: The exact implementation might vary based on the specific configuration of the "StructType" struct and how "fields" attribute is defined in self object. You need to replace `fields` with the actual field name in Rust struct/object and `StructType::new` with the proper function for creating a new instance of StructType depending on your Rust codebase. Ensure that the StructType struct and the as_struct method are in the same scope for this to work. The clone() method was used assuming fields is a cloneable type. If it's not, you may need to use a different method to create a copy/clone.</translated function>In the given Python function, it appears that 'fields' are attributes of the object and 'StructType' is a constructor that takes these fields as arguments.
