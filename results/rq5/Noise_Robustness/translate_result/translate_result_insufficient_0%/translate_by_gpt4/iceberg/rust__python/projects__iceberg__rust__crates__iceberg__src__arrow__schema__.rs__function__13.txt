Here is the equivalent Rust function for the given Python function:

```rust
pub fn arrow_schema_to_schema(schema: &ArrowSchema, name_mapping: Option<HashMap<String, String>>) -> Result<Schema, &'static str> {
    let has_ids = visit_arrow(schema, HasIds::new());
    
    let visitor: Box<dyn SchemaVisitor<Result<Schema>>> = if has_ids {
        Box::new(ConvertToIceberg::new())
    } else if let Some(mapping) = name_mapping {
        Box::new(ConvertToIceberg::with_name_mapping(mapping))
    } else {
        return Err("Parquet file does not have field-ids and the Iceberg table does not have 'schema.name-mapping.default' defined");
    };
    
    visit_arrow(schema, &mut *visitor)
}
```

This code is creating a new schema visitor based on whether the given schema has identifiers or a specific name mapping. Errors are raised right in-place by returning a Result with Err value when the conditions are not satisfied.

Please note that you may need to define the `HasIds` and `ConvertToIceberg` structs and the associated `visit_arrow()` method because they are not provided in the initial context. The definitions of those can be similar to the `_HasIds` and `_ConvertToIceberg` in your python code.

Also, the implementation of `HasIds` and `ConvertToIceberg` as well as `SchemaVisitor` and `visit_arrow` are only inferred from the Python code you provided and might not completely reflect your requirements, so please modify accordingly. Finally, you may also need to adjust error handling depending on your project's error handling strategy.

Looking at your original Python function, it would also be more similar to your Python code to define a `SchemaVisitor` trait with a `visit_arrow` method so the `HasIds` and `ConvertToIceberg` can be used more flexibly.</translated function>Here is the equivalent Rust function for the given Python function:
