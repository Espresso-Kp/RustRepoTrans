<translated function>
The Python function seems to interact with some internal function `_contains_nans_only` and uses internal constants `ROWS_CANNOT_MATCH` and `ROWS_MIGHT_MATCH`. A direct conversion is not feasible here as it requires knowledge on these implementations. Still, here's a template you can follow:

<rust function>

```rust
fn not_nan(&mut self, reference: &BoundReference) -> crate::Result<bool> {
    let field_id = reference.field.field_id;

    if self.contains_nans_only(field_id)? {
        return Ok(false);
    }

    Ok(true)
}
```

Note:

1. This conversion implies that a function named `contains_nans_only` exists in your Rust struct/object with the same behavior as the Python's `_contains_nans_only`.

2. Both `ROWS_CANNOT_MATCH` and `ROWS_MIGHT_MATCH` seem to be constants/signals that indicate the matching results of the rows in Python function, it might not exist in your Rust side, so I replaced them with boolean values. But you should adjust them according to your needs.

3. I modified the function signature as `reference: &BoundReference` from `reference: &BoundReference, _predicate: &BoundPredicate`, because `predicate` is not being used in the function implementation. If it's needed in your overall code design, you can simply add it back.

4. The Rust function will return `Result<bool>` type rather than returning `bool`. It's a common practice in Rust to indicate that a function could potentially fail (similar to Python's Exception). If an error happens during the function call (e.g., `contains_nans_only` operation failed), it will be caught and returned as an `Error` Type. Client code needs to unwrap it before accessing the boolean value. If you do not intend to handle the error here, you can remove the `?` and it will panic with the error message when it fails.

5. Since there's nothing provided in the "rust function related variable, functions, and data type declarations" placeholder, it's assumed that no additional data types or logic is needed.</translated function>The Python function seems to interact with some internal function `_contains_nans_only` and uses internal constants `ROWS_CANNOT_MATCH` and `ROWS_MIGHT_MATCH`.
