        .duration_since(UNIX_EPOCH)

<translated function>
Here is the rust function:

```rust
pub fn today() -> usize {
    let since_unix_epoch = SystemTime::now()
        .duration_since(UNIX_EPOCH)
        .expect("Time went backwards");
    since_unix_epoch.as_secs() as usize / (60 * 1440)
}
```

You have some unused imports in the provided libraries, those can be cleaned up. Only the SystemTime and UNIX_EPOCH is used. It would simplify to:

```rust
use std::time::{SystemTime, UNIX_EPOCH};
```

Please, note that if you get the error "Time went backwards" make sure that your system's time is set correctly and that you're not exceeding the upper bound of what SystemTime can represent (usually a few hundred years in the future).</translated function>Here is the rust function:
