please translate the given c function to rust according to the rust function signature, rust function realted variable, functions, and data type declarations and rust function dependency libraries I provide(delimited with XML tags). Only response the translated function results.

In Rust, you could return an `Option<&str>` which is a similar pattern for returning a value, or a `None` value. Rust doesn't need manual memory management so `dc_strdup` are not necessary. We would need to know the full details of your `Param` type, how you map keys to values and what 'find_param' correspond to. So given the constraints and assumptions, this is a rough conversion of the C code to Rust code:

```rust
pub fn get(&self, key: &Param) -> Option<&'static str> {
    if key.is_empty() {
        return None;
    }

    let p1 = self.find_param(key);
    match p1 {
        None => None,
        Some(p) => Some(p.trim())  // to be safe with '\r' characters ...
    }  
}
```

Assuming `self.find_param()` is a method that inputs a key and fetches the corresponding value, this is a rough translation but without the full `Param` struct or the `find_param()` implementation, it's a bit hard to do a complete translation. The key would need to be mapped to values, and the error handling would need to be checked if `find_param()` return `Option` or `Result`. And in Rust we don't modify the original data, instead we create a new one.</translated function>In Rust, you could return an `Option<&str>` which is a similar pattern for returning a value, or a `None` value.
