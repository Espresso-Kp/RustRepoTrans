please translate the given c function to rust according to the rust function signature, rust function realted variable, functions, and data type declarations and rust function dependency libraries I provide(delimited with XML tags). Only response the translated function results.

	param->packed = calloc(1, 1);

    return param;

Based on your provided information, it seems the `dc_param_t` struct in C is represented as `Self` in Rust. Here is a direct translation:

```rust
pub fn new() -> Self {
    let mut param = Self {
        packed: None,
        // other properties, if any, initialize them here.
    };

    param.packed = Some(vec![0]); // it seems to allocate just a single byte in C

    param
}
```

Your question didn't provide the Rust definition of the struct `dc_param_t` (or whatever you use in Rust to represent `dc_param_t`). Please replace `packed: None,` and `packed: Some(vec![0])` with the correct code if `packed` is not represented as `Option<Vec<u8>>`.

Also, the C version of the function exits the program if the allocation fails. In Rust, if the allocation fails it will stop the program with a panic automatically, so there is no need for any equivalent of `exit(28)`. 

This code assumes you're representing `dc_param_t` as a struct in Rust (here referred to as `Self`). Replace `Self` with the actual name of your struct if you're using a different definition.

This code directly allocates memory in the same way `calloc` does, but it doesn't have a similar "manual handling" of allocation failure as in your C function. If you want similar handling, consider using the `std::alloc` or `alloc` crate, although this is usually not needed in Rust.</translated function>Based on your provided information, it seems the `dc_param_t` struct in C is represented as `Self` in Rust.
