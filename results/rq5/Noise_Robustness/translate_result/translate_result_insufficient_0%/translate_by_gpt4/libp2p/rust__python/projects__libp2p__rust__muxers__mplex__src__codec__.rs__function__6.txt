In Rust, you can not do exact clone of an instance and change some attributes like in Python due to its low-level nature. However, you can make a similar function with the same rationale. This would involve creating a method within the struct that creates a new instance of itself and increases the channel_id by 1.

Let's assume that you have a struct that contains a field named `channel_id` of type `u32`, the function might look something like this:

```rust
use asynchronous_codec::{Decoder, Encoder};
use bytes::{BufMut, Bytes, BytesMut};
use libp2p_core::Endpoint;
use std::{
    fmt,
    hash::{Hash, Hasher},
    io, mem,
};
use unsigned_varint::{codec, encode};
use super::*;

#[derive(Clone)] // You need a clone for the method to work.
pub(crate) struct SomeStruct {
    channel_id: u32,
    // Other fields...
}

impl SomeStruct {
    // The function
    pub(crate) fn next(mut self) -> Self {
        self.channel_id += 1;
        self
    }
}
```

This version of the `next` function takes ownership of `self` and returns a modified version of `self`. Since it returns ownership to the caller, the caller can decide whether it wants to keep `self` available for further use by shadowing it with the new version or discard the original.

Please adjust the struct and field name based on your actual use case. If there are more complex fields that need to be manually cloned, you might have to implement the `Clone` trait yourself.</translated function>In Rust, you can not do exact clone of an instance and change some attributes like in Python due to its low-level nature.
