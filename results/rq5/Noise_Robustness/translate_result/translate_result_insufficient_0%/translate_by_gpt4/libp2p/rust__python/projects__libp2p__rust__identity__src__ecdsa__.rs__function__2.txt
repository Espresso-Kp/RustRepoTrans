<translated function>
Based on the given Python function and the Rust dependencies and function signature you have provided, here is the translated Rust version:

```rust
pub fn sign(&self, msg: &[u8]) -> Vec<u8> {
    self.impl_.sign(msg).as_ref().to_vec()
}
```
Some notes:

* I am assuming that `self.impl_` has a `sign` method that behaves similarly to the Python version -- that is, it takes a byte array (here, a reference to a byte slice) and returns a value that we can call `as_ref().to_vec()` on to convert into a vector of bytes. Without additional context, I cannot guarantee that this is accurate.

* Typical Rust naming conventions use snake_case for variable and method names, so `impl` from your Python code is translated as `impl_` in Rust.

* Rust doesn't have a direct equivalent of Python's `bytes` type. The closest types are slices and vectors of `u8` (unsigned 8-bit integers), i.e., `&[u8]` and `Vec<u8>`. For inputs, it is common to use slices because they can be used to view data stored in a variety of locations (such as a `Vec<u8>`, an array, or a string) without copying it. For outputs, a `Vec<u8>` is used because it is owned data that can be freely modified.

The translated function takes a reference to a byte array (`&[u8]`) as input and returns a byte vector (`Vec<u8>`).</translated function>Based on the given Python function and the Rust dependencies and function signature you have provided, here is the translated Rust version:
