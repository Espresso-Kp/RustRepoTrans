Here is the translated Rust function:
```rust
pub fn set(&mut self, i: usize, x: Chunk) {
    self.w[i] = x;
}
```
Note that I've assumed that `self` is a reference to the current instance of the struct that `w` is a field of, and that `w` is a field of that struct. If that's not the case, please provide more information about the struct and its fields.</translated function>Here is the translated Rust function:
