Here is the translated Rust function:
```rust
pub fn sub(&mut self, x: &Big) {
    for i in 0..NLEN {
        self.w[i] -= x.w[i];
    }
}
```
Note that I assumed `NLEN` is a constant or a field of the struct that `self` is an instance of, and `w` is a field of the same struct. If that's not the case, please provide more information about the context.</translated function>Here is the translated Rust function:
