pub fn zero(&mut self) {

Here is the translated Rust function:
```rust
pub fn zero(&mut self) {
    for i in 0..self.NLEN {
        self.w[i] = 0;
    }
}
```
Note that I assumed `NLEN` and `w` are fields of the struct that this function is part of, and that `w` is an array or vector of some type that can be assigned a value of 0. If that's not the case, please provide more information about the types and fields involved.</translated function>Here is the translated Rust function:
