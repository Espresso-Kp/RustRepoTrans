please translate the given python function to rust according to the rust function signature, rust function dependencies(including function and variable dependencies), and data type declarations and rust function dependency libraries I provide(delimited with XML tags).Please make sure to call the relevant dependencies as much as possible in the translated function Only response the translated function results.

<translated function>
Here's the translated Rust function based on the provided Python function, Rust function signature, and dependencies:

```rust
fn remove(&mut self, k: &Key) {
    self.connections.remove(k);
}
```

This translated function assumes that `self.connections` is a `HashMap` or similar collection that has a `remove` method. The `Key` type is used instead of `PeerId` as specified in the Rust function signature. The function removes the connection associated with the given key from the `connections` collection.

Note that this translation simplifies the original Python function, as it doesn't include the initial check for the existence of the key in the collection. In Rust, calling `remove` on a `HashMap` with a non-existent key is safe and doesn't cause any errors, so this check is not strictly necessary.</translated function>Here's the translated Rust function based on the provided Python function, Rust function signature, and dependencies:
