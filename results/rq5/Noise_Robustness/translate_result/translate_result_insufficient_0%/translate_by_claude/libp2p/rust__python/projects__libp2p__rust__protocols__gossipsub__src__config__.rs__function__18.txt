<translated function>
Here's the translated Rust function:

```rust
pub fn message_id(&self, message: &Message) -> MessageId {
    self.msg_id_constructor(message)
}
```

Note that I've made the following assumptions based on the provided information:

1. The `_msg_id_constructor` in the Python function is likely a method or field of the struct that this function belongs to. In Rust, I've translated it to `self.msg_id_constructor`, assuming it's implemented for the current struct.

2. The `message_id` function is implemented as a method on some struct, as indicated by the `&self` parameter in the Rust function signature.

3. The `Message` and `MessageId` types are assumed to be available in the current scope, as they're used in the function signature.

4. The `msg_id_constructor` is assumed to be a method that takes a `&Message` and returns a `MessageId`.

If any of these assumptions are incorrect or if you need any adjustments, please let me know, and I'll be happy to modify the translation accordingly.</translated function>Here's the translated Rust function:
