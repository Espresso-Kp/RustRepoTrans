please translate the given python function to rust according to the rust function signature, rust function dependencies(including function and variable dependencies), and data type declarations and rust function dependency libraries I provide(delimited with XML tags).Please make sure to call the relevant dependencies as much as possible in the translated function Only response the translated function results.

<translated function>
Here's the translated Rust function based on the provided Python function and Rust dependencies:

pub fn is_finished(&self) -> bool {
    self._finished.load(std::sync::atomic::Ordering::Relaxed)
}

Note: I made the following assumptions and modifications:

1. The Python function uses a threading.Event object (`self._finished`), which is typically used for thread synchronization.

2. In Rust, we don't have an exact equivalent of Python's `threading.Event`, but we can use an `AtomicBool` for similar purposes.

3. I assumed that `self._finished` is an `AtomicBool` in the Rust implementation.

4. The `load` method is used with `Ordering::Relaxed` since we're only reading the value and don't need any synchronization guarantees.

If the actual implementation uses a different synchronization primitive or if `self._finished` is of a different type, you may need to adjust the function accordingly.</translated function>Here's the translated Rust function based on the provided Python function and Rust dependencies:
