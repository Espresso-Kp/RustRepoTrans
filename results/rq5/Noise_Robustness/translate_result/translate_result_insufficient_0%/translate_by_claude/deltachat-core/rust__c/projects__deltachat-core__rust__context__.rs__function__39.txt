please translate the given c function to rust according to the rust function signature, rust function dependencies(including function and variable dependencies), and data type declarations and rust function dependency libraries I provide(delimited with XML tags).Please make sure to call the relevant dependencies as much as possible in the translated function Only response the translated function results.
<c function>
* function not under the control of the core (eg. #DC_EVENT_HTTP_GET). Another
 * reason for dc_stop_ongoing_process() not to wait is that otherwise it
 * would be GUI-blocking and should be started in another thread then; this
 * would make things even more complicated.
 *
 * Typical ongoing processes are started by dc_configure(),
 * dc_initiate_key_transfer() or dc_imex(). As there is always at most only
 * one onging process at the same time, there is no need to define _which_ process to exit.
 *
 * @memberof dc_context_t
 * @param context The context object.
 * @return None.

<translated function>
Here's the translated Rust function based on the provided C function and Rust function signature:

```rust
pub async fn stop_ongoing(&self) {
    if self.ongoing_running.load(Ordering::Relaxed) && !self.shall_stop_ongoing.load(Ordering::Relaxed) {
        self.log_info(0, "Signaling the ongoing process to stop ASAP.".to_string());
        self.shall_stop_ongoing.store(true, Ordering::Relaxed);
    } else {
        self.log_info(0, "No ongoing process to stop.".to_string());
    }
}
```

This translation assumes that:

1. `self.ongoing_running` and `self.shall_stop_ongoing` are `AtomicBool` types, as they are being accessed concurrently.
2. `self.log_info` is an asynchronous method that takes an integer and a string as arguments.
3. The `context` in the C function is represented by `self` in the Rust method.

The function checks if there's an ongoing process running and if it hasn't been signaled to stop yet. If so, it logs a message and sets the `shall_stop_ongoing` flag to true. If there's no ongoing process or it has already been signaled to stop, it logs a different message.

Note that this translation doesn't include any null checks or magic number checks, as those are typically handled differently in Rust (through the type system and Option types). If you need similar checks in Rust, you'd typically handle them at a higher level or in the struct's implementation.</translated function>Here's the translated Rust function based on the provided C function and Rust function signature:
