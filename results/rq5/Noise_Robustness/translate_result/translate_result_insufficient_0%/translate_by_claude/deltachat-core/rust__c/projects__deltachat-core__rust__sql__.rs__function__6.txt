please translate the given c function to rust according to the rust function signature, rust function dependencies(including function and variable dependencies), and data type declarations and rust function dependency libraries I provide(delimited with XML tags).Please make sure to call the relevant dependencies as much as possible in the translated function Only response the translated function results.

<translated function>
Here's the translated Rust function based on the provided C function and Rust function signature:

```rust
async fn close(&self) {
    if let Some(cobj) = self.cobj.lock().await.take() {
        cobj.close().unwrap();
    }
}
```

This translation assumes that:

1. The `self` parameter is a reference to a struct that contains a `cobj` field.
2. The `cobj` field is of type `Mutex<Option<Connection>>`, where `Connection` is from the `rusqlite` crate.
3. The `close()` method is available on the `Connection` type.

The function uses async/await syntax as specified in the Rust function signature. It acquires the lock on `cobj`, takes the value if it exists (replacing it with `None`), and then closes the connection.

Note that this translation might need adjustments based on the exact structure of your Rust code and how you're managing the SQLite connection. The error handling is simplified here, using `unwrap()` instead of proper error propagation, which you might want to improve in a production environment.</translated function>Here's the translated Rust function based on the provided C function and Rust function signature:
