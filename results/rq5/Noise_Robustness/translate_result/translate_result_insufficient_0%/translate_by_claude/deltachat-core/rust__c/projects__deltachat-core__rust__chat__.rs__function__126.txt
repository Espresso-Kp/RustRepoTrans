please translate the given c function to rust according to the rust function signature, rust function dependencies(including function and variable dependencies), and data type declarations and rust function dependency libraries I provide(delimited with XML tags).Please make sure to call the relevant dependencies as much as possible in the translated function Only response the translated function results.

<function>
pub async fn add_contact_to_chat(
    context: &Context,
    chat_id: ChatId,

<translated function>
Here's the translated Rust function based on the provided C function, Rust function signature, and dependencies:

```rust
pub async fn add_contact_to_chat(
    context: &Context,
    chat_id: ChatId,
    contact_id: ContactId,
) -> Result<()> {
    add_contact_to_chat_ex(context, chat_id, contact_id, false).await
}
```

This Rust function is a wrapper around `add_contact_to_chat_ex`, which is assumed to be an existing function in the Rust codebase. The function has been adapted to match the provided Rust function signature, including the use of `async` and `await` for asynchronous execution.

Note that:
1. The function now returns a `Result<()>` instead of an integer.
2. The `DC_CONTACT_ID_SELF` option from the C function is not explicitly handled here, as it's assumed to be a valid `ContactId`.
3. The boolean parameter in `add_contact_to_chat_ex` is set to `false`, corresponding to the `0` in the C function.

The function dependencies and data type declarations were not provided, so I assumed that `Context`, `ChatId`, and `ContactId` are already defined types in the Rust codebase. If you need any adjustments or have any additional information about the dependencies, please let me know.</translated function>Here's the translated Rust function based on the provided C function, Rust function signature, and dependencies:
