please translate the given c function to rust according to the rust function signature, rust function dependencies(including function and variable dependencies), and data type declarations and rust function dependency libraries I provide(delimited with XML tags).Please make sure to call the relevant dependencies as much as possible in the translated function Only response the translated function results.

<function>
pub fn degrade_encryption(&mut self, message_time: i64) {

<translated function>
Here's the translated Rust function based on the provided C function and Rust function signature:

```rust
pub fn degrade_encryption(&mut self, message_time: i64) {
    if self.prefer_encrypt == EncryptPreference::Mutual {
        self.degrade_event |= DegradeEvent::ENCRYPTION_PAUSED;
    }

    self.prefer_encrypt = EncryptPreference::Reset;
    self.last_seen = message_time; // last_seen_autocrypt is not updated as there was no Autocrypt-header seen
}
```

Note that I made the following assumptions and changes:

1. The `peerstate` parameter in the C function is replaced by `self` in the Rust function, as it's a method on a struct.
2. I assumed that `DC_PE_MUTUAL`, `DC_PE_RESET`, and `DC_DE_ENCRYPTION_PAUSED` have corresponding Rust enum variants `EncryptPreference::Mutual`, `EncryptPreference::Reset`, and `DegradeEvent::ENCRYPTION_PAUSED` respectively.
3. The `time_t` type in C is replaced with `i64` in Rust, as specified in the function signature.
4. The null check at the beginning of the C function is not necessary in Rust due to the borrow checker ensuring that `self` is always valid.
5. I kept the comment about `last_seen_autocrypt` as it provides important context.

Please note that this translation assumes the existence of certain enum types (`EncryptPreference` and `DegradeEvent`) and struct fields (`prefer_encrypt`, `degrade_event`, `last_seen`) that should be defined in your Rust code based on the original C structure.</translated function>Here's the translated Rust function based on the provided C function and Rust function signature:
