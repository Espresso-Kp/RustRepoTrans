please translate the given c function to rust according to the rust function signature, rust function dependencies(including function and variable dependencies), and data type declarations and rust function dependency libraries I provide(delimited with XML tags).Please make sure to call the relevant dependencies as much as possible in the translated function Only response the translated function results.

pub fn get_id(&self) -> ContactId {

</function>
<translated function>
Here's the translated Rust function based on the provided C function and Rust function signature:

```rust
pub fn get_id(&self) -> ContactId {
    self.id
}
```

This translation assumes that:

1. The `ContactId` type is defined elsewhere in the Rust code and is equivalent to the `uint32_t` used in the C function.
2. The `self` parameter in the Rust function signature represents the `dc_contact_t` struct from the C function.
3. The `id` field is directly accessible on `self` in Rust, similar to how it was accessed via `contact->id` in C.

The null check and magic number check from the C function are not included in the Rust translation because:

1. Rust's ownership system and Option type typically handle null checks at compile-time.
2. The magic number check is usually not necessary in Rust due to its stronger type system and ownership rules.

If additional checks are required, they should be implemented at the point where the `Contact` struct is created or modified, rather than in this getter method.</translated function>Here's the translated Rust function based on the provided C function and Rust function signature:
