<translated function>
Here's the translated Rust function based on the provided C function and Rust function signature:

```rust
pub fn get_color(&self) -> u32 {
    str_to_color(&self.addr)
}
```

This translation makes the following assumptions and changes:

1. The `self` parameter in the Rust function signature implies that this is a method on a struct (likely representing a contact).

2. The null check and magic number check from the C function are not necessary in Rust due to Rust's ownership and type system. If `self` is available, it's guaranteed to be a valid instance of the struct.

3. The `addr` field is assumed to be a member of the struct that `self` refers to.

4. The `str_to_color` function is called directly on `self.addr`. This assumes that `str_to_color` is available in the current scope, which it should be based on the provided dependency libraries (it's imported from `crate::color::str_to_color`).

5. The default return value of `0x000000` in case of null or invalid magic number is omitted, as those cases should not occur in Rust with proper struct design.

This translation maintains the core functionality of the original C function while adapting it to Rust's idioms and safety guarantees.</translated function>Here's the translated Rust function based on the provided C function and Rust function signature:
