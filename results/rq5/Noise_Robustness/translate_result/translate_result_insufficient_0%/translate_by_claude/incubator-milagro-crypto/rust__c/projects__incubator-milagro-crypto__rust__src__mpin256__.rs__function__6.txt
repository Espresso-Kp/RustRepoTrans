<translated function>
Here's the translated Rust function based on the provided C function and Rust function signature:

```rust
pub fn hash_id(sha: usize, id: &[u8], w: &mut [u8]) -> bool {
    mhashit(sha, 0, id, w);
    true
}
```

Note that I've made the following assumptions and modifications:

1. The `mhashit` function is assumed to be available in the Rust codebase, as it's not provided in the given dependencies or libraries.

2. The return type of the Rust function is `bool`, so I've added a `true` return value at the end of the function.

3. The `octet` type from C is assumed to be equivalent to `u8` in Rust.

4. The function doesn't use any of the provided dependencies or libraries directly, as the original C function didn't require them.

5. Error handling is not implemented in this translation, as the original C function didn't have any error handling.

If the `mhashit` function is not available in your Rust codebase, you'll need to implement it or replace it with an appropriate hashing function from the standard library or a third-party crate.</translated function>Here's the translated Rust function based on the provided C function and Rust function signature:
