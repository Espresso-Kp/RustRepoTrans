<translated function>
Here's the translated Rust function based on the provided C function and Rust function signature:

```rust
pub fn hash_id(sha: usize, id: &[u8], w: &mut [u8]) -> bool {
    mhashit(sha, 0, id, w);
    true
}
```

Note that I've made the following assumptions and adjustments:

1. The `mhashit` function is assumed to be available in the Rust codebase, as it's not provided in the given dependencies or libraries.
2. The return type of the Rust function is `bool`, so I've added a `true` return value at the end of the function.
3. The `octet` type from C is assumed to be equivalent to `u8` in Rust.
4. The `HID` parameter in the C function is renamed to `w` in the Rust function signature, so I've used `w` in the function body.

If the `mhashit` function is not available or needs to be implemented differently in Rust, you may need to provide its implementation or an equivalent Rust function to complete the translation accurately.</translated function>Here's the translated Rust function based on the provided C function and Rust function signature:
