please translate the given java function to rust according to the rust function signature, rust function dependencies(including function and variable dependencies), and data type declarations and rust function dependency libraries I provide(delimited with XML tags).Please make sure to call the relevant dependencies as much as possible in the translated function Only response the translated function results.

<function>
pub fn sub(&mut self, x: &Big) {

<translated function>
Here's the translated Rust function based on the provided Java function, Rust function signature, and dependencies:

pub fn sub(&mut self, x: &Big) {
    for i in 0..NLEN {
        self.w[i] -= x.w[i];
    }
}

This translation assumes that:
1. `NLEN` is a constant defined elsewhere in the Rust code, similar to the Java version.
2. `self.w` and `x.w` are arrays or slices of a numeric type (likely `Chunk` based on the provided dependencies) with at least `NLEN` elements.
3. The subtraction operation is valid for the type of elements in `w`.

The function performs an element-wise subtraction of `x.w` from `self.w` for the first `NLEN` elements.</translated function>Here's the translated Rust function based on the provided Java function, Rust function signature, and dependencies:
