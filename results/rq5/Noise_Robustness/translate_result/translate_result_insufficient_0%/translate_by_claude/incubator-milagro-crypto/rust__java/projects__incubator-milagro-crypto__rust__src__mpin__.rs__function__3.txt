please translate the given java function to rust according to the rust function signature, rust function dependencies(including function and variable dependencies), and data type declarations and rust function dependency libraries I provide(delimited with XML tags).Please make sure to call the relevant dependencies as much as possible in the translated function Only response the translated function results.

<function>
pub fn today() -> usize {
    return (SystemTime::now()
        .duration_since(UNIX_EPOCH)

<translated function>
Here's the translated Rust function based on the provided Java function and Rust dependencies:

pub fn today() -> usize {
    let now = SystemTime::now()
        .duration_since(UNIX_EPOCH)
        .expect("Time went backwards");
    
    (now.as_secs() / (60 * 1440)) as usize
}

This Rust function accomplishes the same task as the Java function:
1. It gets the current system time.
2. Calculates the duration since the Unix epoch.
3. Converts the duration to seconds.
4. Divides by the number of seconds in a day (60 * 1440 = 86400).
5. Casts the result to `usize` as specified in the function signature.

Note that this function uses the `SystemTime` and `UNIX_EPOCH` from the `std::time` module, which were included in the provided dependency libraries.</translated function>Here's the translated Rust function based on the provided Java function and Rust dependencies:
