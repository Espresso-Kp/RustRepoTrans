please translate the given python function to rust according to the rust function signature, rust function dependencies(including function and variable dependencies), and data type declarations and rust function dependency libraries I provide(delimited with XML tags).Please make sure to call the relevant dependencies as much as possible in the translated function Only response the translated function results.

<translated function>
Here's the translated Rust function based on the provided information:

```rust
async fn write(&mut self, batch: RecordBatch) -> Result<()> {
    self.writer.write(batch).await
}
```

This translation assumes that:

1. The `self.writer` is an instance of a type that implements an asynchronous `write` method taking a `RecordBatch` as an argument and returning a `Result<()>`.
2. The `Result` type is imported from the crate root (`use crate::Result;`).

The function is marked as `async` to match the provided signature, and it simply delegates the write operation to `self.writer.write()`, passing along the `batch` argument. The `await` keyword is used to handle the asynchronous nature of the write operation.</translated function>Here's the translated Rust function based on the provided information:
