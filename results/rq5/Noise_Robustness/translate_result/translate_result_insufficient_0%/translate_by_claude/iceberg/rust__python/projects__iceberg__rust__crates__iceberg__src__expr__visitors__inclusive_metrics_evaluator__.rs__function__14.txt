<translated function>
Here's the translated Rust function based on the provided Python function, Rust function signature, and dependencies:

```rust
fn not_nan(
    &mut self,
    reference: &BoundReference,
    _predicate: &BoundPredicate,
) -> crate::Result<bool> {
    let field_id = reference.field().id();

    if self.contains_nans_only(field_id) {
        Ok(false) // ROWS_CANNOT_MATCH
    } else {
        Ok(true) // ROWS_MIGHT_MATCH
    }
}
```

Note that I've made the following assumptions and adaptations:

1. The `self._contains_nans_only(field_id)` method from the Python version is assumed to exist as `self.contains_nans_only(field_id)` in the Rust version.
2. The `ROWS_CANNOT_MATCH` and `ROWS_MIGHT_MATCH` constants are replaced with `false` and `true` respectively, as they seem to represent boolean values.
3. The function returns a `Result<bool>` as per the Rust function signature, so the boolean values are wrapped in `Ok()`.
4. The `term.ref().field.field_id` from the Python version is replaced with `reference.field().id()`, assuming that the `BoundReference` struct has a `field()` method that returns a reference to a field with an `id()` method.

Please note that this translation might need further adjustments based on the exact implementation details of the Rust structs and methods that weren't provided in the given context.</translated function>Here's the translated Rust function based on the provided Python function, Rust function signature, and dependencies:
