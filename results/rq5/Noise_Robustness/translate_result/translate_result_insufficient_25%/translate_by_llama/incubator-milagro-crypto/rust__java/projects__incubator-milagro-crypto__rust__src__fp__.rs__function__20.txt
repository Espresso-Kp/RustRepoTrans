please translate the given java function to rust according to the rust function signature, rust function realted variable, functions, and data type declarations and rust function dependency libraries I provide(delimited with XML tags). Only response the translated function results.

<function>
pub fn norm(&mut self) -> Chunk {
        let mut carry = 0 as Chunk;
        for i in 0..NLEN - 1 {
            let d = self.w[i] + carry;
            self.w[i] = d & BMASK;
            carry = d >> BASEBITS;
        }

<translated function>
Here is the translated Rust function:
```rust
pub fn norm(&mut self) -> Chunk {
    let mut carry = 0;
    for i in 0..NLEN - 1 {
        let d = self.w[i] + carry;
        self.w[i] = d & (1 << BASEBITS) - 1;
        carry = d >> BASEBITS;
    }
    self.w[NLEN - 1] = (self.w[NLEN - 1] + carry) & (1 << BASEBITS) - 1;
    (self.w[NLEN - 1] >> ((8 * MODBYTES) % BASEBITS)) as Chunk
}
```
Note that I assumed `w` is a field of the struct that this function is part of, and that `Chunk` is a type that can be created from a `usize` value. I also assumed that `BASEBITS` is a constant that represents the number of bits in a word, and that `MODBYTES` is a constant that represents the number of bytes in a modulus.</translated function>Here is the translated Rust function:
