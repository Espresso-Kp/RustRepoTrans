<translated function>
Here is the translated Rust function:
```rust
pub async fn delete(&self, path: impl AsRef<str>) -> Result<()> {
    let path = path.as_ref();
    let scheme = Url::parse(path).unwrap().scheme();
    let fs = self.fs_by_scheme(scheme);

    fs.delete_file(path).await?;
    Ok(())
}
```
Note that I've assumed that `fs_by_scheme` is a method on `self` that returns a `Storage` instance, and that `delete_file` is an async method on `Storage` that takes a `&str` path. I've also assumed that `Result` is a type alias for `std::result::Result<(), Error>`. If these assumptions are incorrect, please let me know and I'll adjust the translation accordingly.</translated function>Here is the translated Rust function:
