please translate the given c function to rust according to the rust function signature, rust function dependencies(including function and variable dependencies), and data type declarations and rust function dependency libraries I provide(delimited with XML tags).Please make sure to call the relevant dependencies as much as possible in the translated function Only response the translated function results.

<translated function>
Here's the translated Rust function based on the provided C function, Rust function signature, dependencies, and libraries:

```rust
pub fn get_int(&self, key: Param) -> Option<i32> {
    self.inner.get(&key).and_then(|str_value| {
        str_value.parse::<i32>().ok()
    })
}
```

This Rust function does the following:

1. It takes `&self` (referring to the `Params` struct) and a `key` of type `Param` as input.
2. It returns an `Option<i32>`, which will be `None` if the key is not found or the value can't be parsed as an `i32`.
3. It uses the `BTreeMap` method `get` to retrieve the value associated with the key.
4. If a value is found, it attempts to parse it as an `i32` using the `parse` method.
5. The `and_then` method is used to chain these operations and return `None` if either the key is not found or the parsing fails.

This implementation differs slightly from the C function in that it doesn't use a default value. Instead, it returns an `Option`, which is more idiomatic in Rust. If a default value is needed, it can be handled by the caller using the `unwrap_or` method on the `Option`.</translated function>Here's the translated Rust function based on the provided C function, Rust function signature, dependencies, and libraries:
