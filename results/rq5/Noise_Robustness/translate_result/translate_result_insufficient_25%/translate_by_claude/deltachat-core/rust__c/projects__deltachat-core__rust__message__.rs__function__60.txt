pub fn is_setupmessage(&self) -> bool {
        if self.viewtype != Viewtype::File {

<translated function>
Here's the translated Rust function based on the provided C function and Rust dependencies:

```rust
pub fn is_setupmessage(&self) -> bool {
    if let Some(system_message) = self.get_system_message() {
        matches!(system_message, SystemMessage::AutocryptSetupMessage)
    } else {
        false
    }
}
```

This Rust function assumes that the `self` parameter is a message struct that has a method `get_system_message()` which returns an `Option<SystemMessage>`. The function checks if the message is an Autocrypt Setup Message by matching against the `SystemMessage::AutocryptSetupMessage` variant.

Note that this translation makes some assumptions about the structure of the Rust message type, as the exact equivalent of the C struct `dc_msg_t` is not provided in the given Rust dependencies. The logic has been adapted to use the `SystemMessage` enum provided in the Rust dependencies.</translated function>Here's the translated Rust function based on the provided C function and Rust dependencies:
