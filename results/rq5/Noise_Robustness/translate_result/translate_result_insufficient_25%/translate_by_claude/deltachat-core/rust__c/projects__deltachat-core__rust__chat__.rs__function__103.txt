<translated function>
Here's the translated Rust function based on the provided C function, Rust function signature, dependencies, and libraries:

```rust
pub async fn is_contact_in_chat(
    context: &Context,
    chat_id: ChatId,
    contact_id: ContactId,
) -> Result<bool> {
    // This function works for group and normal chats, however, it is more useful for group chats.
    // DC_CONTACT_ID_SELF may be used to check if the user itself is in a group chat
    // (DC_CONTACT_ID_SELF is not added to normal chats)

    let sql = "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM chats_contacts WHERE chat_id=? AND contact_id=?";
    let params = rusqlite::params![chat_id, contact_id];

    context.inner.sql.exists(sql, params).await
}
```

This Rust function accomplishes the same task as the original C function while adhering to Rust idioms and using the provided dependencies. Here are the key changes and explanations:

1. The function signature matches the provided Rust signature, including the `async` keyword and `Result<bool>` return type.

2. Instead of using raw SQL statements and manual SQLite bindings, we use the `exists` method provided in the dependencies. This method abstracts away the low-level SQLite operations and error handling.

3. The SQL query is simplified to just the SELECT statement, as the `exists` method handles the count comparison internally.

4. We use `rusqlite::params!` macro to safely bind the parameters to the SQL query.

5. Error handling is implicitly managed by the `Result` type, eliminating the need for explicit cleanup and goto statements.

6. The function now returns a `bool` wrapped in a `Result`, which is more idiomatic in Rust for handling potential errors.

7. The comments from the original C function are preserved to maintain context and explanation of the function's purpose.

This translation maintains the core functionality of the original C function while leveraging Rust's safety features and the provided context structure.</translated function>Here's the translated Rust function based on the provided C function, Rust function signature, dependencies, and libraries:
