please translate the given java function to rust according to the rust function signature, rust function dependencies(including function and variable dependencies), and data type declarations and rust function dependency libraries I provide(delimited with XML tags).Please make sure to call the relevant dependencies as much as possible in the translated function Only response the translated function results.

pub fn norm(&mut self) -> Chunk {
        let mut carry = 0 as Chunk;
        for i in 0..NLEN - 1 {
            let d = self.w[i] + carry;

            carry = d >> BASEBITS;
        }

<translated function>
Here's the translated Rust function based on the provided Java function, Rust function signature, dependencies, and libraries:

```rust
pub fn norm(&mut self) -> Chunk {
    let mut carry: Chunk = 0;
    for i in 0..NLEN - 1 {
        let d: Chunk = self.w[i] + carry;
        self.w[i] = d & arch::BMASK;
        carry = d >> arch::BASEBITS;
    }
    self.w[NLEN - 1] = self.w[NLEN - 1] + carry;
    (self.w[NLEN - 1] >> ((8 * MODBYTES) % arch::BASEBITS)) as Chunk
}
```

This translation assumes that:
1. `self.w` is an array of `Chunk` type, similar to the Java `w` array.
2. `BMASK` and `BASEBITS` are defined in the `arch` module.
3. The `Chunk` type is used for all integer operations, as it's the return type of the function.

The function follows the same logic as the Java version, normalizing the big number representation and returning the most significant bits of the last element.</translated function>Here's the translated Rust function based on the provided Java function, Rust function signature, dependencies, and libraries:
