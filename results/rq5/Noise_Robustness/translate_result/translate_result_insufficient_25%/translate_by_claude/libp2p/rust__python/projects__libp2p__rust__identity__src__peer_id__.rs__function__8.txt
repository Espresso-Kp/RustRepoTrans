<translated function>
Here's the translated Rust function:

```rust
pub fn to_base58(self) -> String {
    bs58::encode(self.to_bytes()).into_string()
}
```

This translation assumes that the `bs58` crate is available and imported, as it's commonly used for base58 encoding in Rust. If it's not already included in your project, you might need to add it to your `Cargo.toml` file and import it at the top of your Rust file.

The function calls `self.to_bytes()` to get the byte representation of the object, then uses `bs58::encode()` to encode it to base58, and finally converts it to a `String` with `into_string()`.</translated function>Here's the translated Rust function:
