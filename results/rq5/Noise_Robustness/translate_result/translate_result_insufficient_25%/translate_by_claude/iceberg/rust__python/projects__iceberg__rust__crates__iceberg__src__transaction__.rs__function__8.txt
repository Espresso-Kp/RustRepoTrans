<translated function>
Here's the translated Rust function based on the provided Python function, Rust function signature, dependencies, and libraries:

```rust
pub async fn commit(self, catalog: &impl Catalog) -> Result<Table> {
    let mut transaction = Transaction {
        table: self.table,
        updates: self.updates,
        requirements: vec![TableRequirement::AssertCreate],
    };

    let committed_table = catalog.commit_transaction(transaction).await?;
    Ok(committed_table)
}
```

This Rust function implements the `commit` operation for a transaction. It creates a `Transaction` struct with the table, updates, and requirements (in this case, only `AssertCreate`). Then it calls the `commit_transaction` method on the provided catalog and returns the resulting `Table`.

Note that I've made some assumptions and adaptations:

1. The `AssertCreate` requirement is represented as `TableRequirement::AssertCreate`.
2. The `commit_transaction` method is assumed to be implemented on the `Catalog` trait.
3. The function is marked as `async` and returns a `Result<Table>` as per the provided signature.
4. Error handling is done using the `?` operator, which propagates any errors that might occur during the commit process.</translated function>Here's the translated Rust function based on the provided Python function, Rust function signature, dependencies, and libraries:
