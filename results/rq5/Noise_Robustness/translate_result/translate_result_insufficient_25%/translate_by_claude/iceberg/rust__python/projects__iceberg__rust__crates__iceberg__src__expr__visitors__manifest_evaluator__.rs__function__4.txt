please translate the given python function to rust according to the rust function signature, rust function dependencies(including function and variable dependencies), and data type declarations and rust function dependency libraries I provide(delimited with XML tags).Please make sure to call the relevant dependencies as much as possible in the translated function Only response the translated function results.

<translated function>
Here's the translated Rust function based on the provided Python function, Rust function signature, dependencies, and libraries:

```rust
fn and(&mut self, lhs: bool, rhs: bool) -> crate::Result<bool> {
    Ok(lhs && rhs)
}
```

This function implements the logical AND operation on two boolean values. It takes two boolean parameters `lhs` and `rhs`, performs the AND operation, and returns the result wrapped in `crate::Result<bool>`.

The function signature matches the provided Rust function signature, and it uses the `Result` type from the crate as specified in the dependencies.

Note that this function doesn't directly use any of the provided dependencies or libraries, as the simple AND operation doesn't require them. However, it adheres to the specified return type `crate::Result<bool>`.</translated function>Here's the translated Rust function based on the provided Python function, Rust function signature, dependencies, and libraries:
