please translate the given python function to rust according to the rust function signature, rust function dependencies(including function and variable dependencies), and data type declarations and rust function dependency libraries I provide(delimited with XML tags).Please make sure to call the relevant dependencies as much as possible in the translated function Only response the translated function results.

<translated function>
Here's the translated Rust function based on the provided Python function, Rust function signature, dependencies, and libraries:

```rust
pub async fn delete(&self, path: impl AsRef<str>) -> Result<()> {
    let str_path = path.as_ref();
    let url = Url::parse(str_path).map_err(|e| Error::new(ErrorKind::InvalidInput, e))?;
    
    let scheme = url.scheme();
    let netloc = url.host_str().unwrap_or("");
    let path = url.path();

    let operator = self.inner.get_operator(scheme, netloc)?;

    operator.delete(path).await.map_err(|e| {
        match e.kind() {
            opendal::ErrorKind::NotFound => Error::new(ErrorKind::NotFound, e),
            opendal::ErrorKind::PermissionDenied => Error::new(ErrorKind::PermissionDenied, e),
            _ => Error::new(ErrorKind::Unexpected, e),
        }
    })?;

    Ok(())
}
```

This Rust implementation follows the provided function signature and uses the dependencies and libraries specified. It performs the following steps:

1. Converts the input `path` to a string.
2. Parses the path as a URL.
3. Extracts the scheme, netloc (host), and path from the URL.
4. Gets the appropriate operator from the inner storage based on the scheme and netloc.
5. Attempts to delete the file using the operator.
6. Maps any errors to the appropriate Error types.

Note that this implementation assumes that the `Storage` struct has a method `get_operator` that returns an `Operator` based on the scheme and netloc. If this method doesn't exist, you may need to implement it or adjust the code accordingly.</translated function>Here's the translated Rust function based on the provided Python function, Rust function signature, dependencies, and libraries:
