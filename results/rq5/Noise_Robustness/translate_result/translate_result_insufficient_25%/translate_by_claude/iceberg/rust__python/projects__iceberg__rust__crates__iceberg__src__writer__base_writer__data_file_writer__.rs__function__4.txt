async fn write(&mut self, batch: RecordBatch) -> Result<()> {

<translated function>
Here's the translated Rust function based on the provided information:

```rust
async fn write(&mut self, batch: RecordBatch) -> Result<()> {
    if let Some(writer) = &mut self.inner_writer {
        writer.write(batch).await?;
    } else {
        // Handle the case where inner_writer is None
        return Err(crate::Error::InternalError("Inner writer is not initialized".to_string()));
    }
    Ok(())
}
```

This translation takes into account the provided Rust function signature, dependencies, and data type declarations. It assumes that `self.inner_writer` is an `Option<B::R>` where `B::R` implements a method called `write` that takes a `RecordBatch` and returns a `Result<()>`.

The function checks if `inner_writer` is `Some`, and if so, it calls the `write` method on it. If `inner_writer` is `None`, it returns an error.

Note that this translation makes some assumptions about the error handling and the exact nature of the `inner_writer`. You may need to adjust the error handling or add more context-specific logic depending on your exact requirements and the rest of your codebase.</translated function>Here's the translated Rust function based on the provided information:
