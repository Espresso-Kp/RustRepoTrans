<translated function>
Based on the given Python function and the corresponding Rust function signature, here's the translated function in Rust:

```rust
pub fn to_bytes(&self) -> [u8; 32] {
    self.0.to_bytes()
}
```

In Rust, `self.0` is how you access the fields of a tuple struct like `SecretKey` is. The `to_bytes()` call is assuming that there is such a method available on the `ed25519::SecretKey` type.

So this function is working under the assumption that your `ed25519::SecretKey` type implements a `to_bytes()` function which returns a `[u8; 32]` bytes. 

Please confirm that `ed25519::SecretKey` have a `to_bytes` method. Also note that if the `to_bytes()` method from the `ed25519::SecretKey` does not return `[u8; 32]` you may need to adjust your function accordingly. 

Also you should import `ed25519::SecretKey` if it is not already imported at the top of your file.

```rust
use ed25519_dalek::SecretKey;
