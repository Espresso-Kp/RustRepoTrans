<translated function>
Here is the translated function in Rust:

```rust
pub fn to_peer_id(&self) -> crate::PeerId {
    PeerId::from_pubkey(self.public_key)
}
```

This is assuming that there is a "from_pubkey" associated function for PeerId that takes a PublicKey as argument in the Rust code, and that "public_key" is a field/property of the struct that this method is implemented for.

Please note that Python and Rust are quite different in terms of supported features and syntax. Therefore, the accuracy of translation heavily depends on exact functionalities of different parts used in Python code and their equivalents in Rust. Always make sure to revise and test the translated code according to specific requirements you may have. For example, the PeerId and PublicKey might need to be fixed according to how they're actually implemented in your Rust code.</translated function>Here is the translated function in Rust:
