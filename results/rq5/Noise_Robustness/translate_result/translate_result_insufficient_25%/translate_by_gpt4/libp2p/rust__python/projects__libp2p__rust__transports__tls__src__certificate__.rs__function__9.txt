<translated function>
Based on your provided Python and Rust context, here is the corresponding Rust method:

```rust
pub fn peer_id(&self) -> PeerId {
    PeerId::from_public_key(self.public_key)
}
```

The `PeerID.from_pubkey` Python method was converted to `PeerId::from_public_key` in Rust. However, note that this function's implementation relies on whether a function named `from_public_key` that takes an instance of `identity::PublicKey` and returns a `PeerId` exists in the `PeerId`'s implementation.

Also, it's important to note that Rust's syntax and typing system are significantly different from Python's. The provided Python function is basically getting the "peer_id" from a public key with a `PeerID` class method. While in Rust, it's assumed that there exists a similar class method in `PeerId` that performs a similar operation. This is just a direct mapping and actual implementation might differ based on additional context or libraries you are using.</translated function>Based on your provided Python and Rust context, here is the corresponding Rust method:
