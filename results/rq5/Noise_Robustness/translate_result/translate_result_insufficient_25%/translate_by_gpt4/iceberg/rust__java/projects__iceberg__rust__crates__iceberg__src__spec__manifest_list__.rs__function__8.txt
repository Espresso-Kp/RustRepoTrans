<function>
pub async fn close(self) -> Result<()> {
        let data = self.avro_writer.into_inner()?;
        let mut writer = self.output_file.writer().await?;

<translated function>
The translated Rust function would be:

```rust
pub async fn close(mut self) -> Result<()> {
    if let Some(mut writer) = self.writer.take() {
        writer.close().await?;
        self.footer = writer.get_footer();
        self.writer = None;
    }
    Ok(())
}
```

Note: Consider that Rust doesn't throw exceptions, instead uses Result for error handling. The given Rust dependencies indicating required libraries and types don't seem to be related directly with the close function (they are more related to serialization and types in Avro), so they are not used here. 

Also, Rust doesn't support direct nullability checking as Java's `!= null` . Instead Option<T> is used which can be None or Some(T). It's commonly used for variables that are nullable such as `writer` in your example. 

The `take()` function is used to replace the Option with None and take its value as Some(writer). 

Also note that `Box<dyn FileWrite>` type you've specified in `writer` function probably should implement `close` method and `get_footer` method as it appears used in Java code. 

Lastly, the `close` method of `writer` appears to be async, as specified in your public method signature to return a future. This should properly handled with `.await.`</translated function>The translated Rust function would be:
