<translated function>
Based on the provided Python function and information, here is the equivalent representation in Rust:

```rust
pub struct Truncate {
    width: u32,
}

impl Truncate {
    pub fn new(width: u32) -> Self {
        Self {width: width}
    }
}
```

In Rust, we implement functions within an `impl` block. Here, `new` is a common constructor function that is used to initialize elements of a struct. The `Self` keyword is used to refer to the instance of the struct we are currently working with, very much like `self` in Python classes. It's also used to denote the return type. The line `Self {width: width}` creates a new `Truncate` instance with the provided `width`. 

The function signature you provided matches exactly with what's normally used for constructor functions in Rust, so there were no changes necessary. 

Please note that the library and other function dependencies aren't required in translating the given Python function into Rust, so they weren't used in the result.</translated function>Based on the provided Python function and information, here is the equivalent representation in Rust:
