<translated function>
Based on the given Python function, the provided Rust signature and related variables and the imported libraries, here's the Rust version of your Python code:

```rust
use arrow_array::RecordBatch;
use crate::Result;

// Assuming that you have a binary function of type BinaryEncoder similar to your python function
// Assuming that you have a Struct type similar to your python function

async fn write(&mut self, batch: RecordBatch) -> Result<()> {
    match self.inner_writer.as_mut() {
        None => Err("No writer available!"),
        Some(writer) => writer.write(&batch, &self.partition_value),
    }
}
```

Please note that this is purely interpretative, the specific details depend on how your BinaryEncoder and Struct relate to Writer and the RecordBatch. Rust uses static typing, so a more precise translation would require more information about how you implement these in Rust. If your BinaryEncoder and Struct respectively match the Rust RecordBatch and Writer functionality in your code logic, then this could be a suitable translation.</translated function>Based on the given Python function, the provided Rust signature and related variables and the imported libraries, here's the Rust version of your Python code:
