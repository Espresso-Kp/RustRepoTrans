please translate the given c function to rust according to the rust function signature, rust function realted variable, functions, and data type declarations and rust function dependency libraries I provide(delimited with XML tags). Only response the translated function results.
<c function>
dc_param_t* dc_param_new()
{
	dc_param_t* param = NULL;

	if ((param=calloc(1, sizeof(dc_param_t)))==NULL) {
		exit(28); /* cannot allocate little memory, unrecoverable error */
	}

	param->packed = calloc(1, 1);

    return param;
}

<translated function>
Given your function signature it seems like you want to implement the `new` function for the `Params` struct. Here is the implementation based on the provided C function.

```rust
pub fn new() -> Self {
    Params {
        inner: BTreeMap::new(),
    }
}
```
The Rust version creates a new `BTreeMap` for `inner` field when an instance of `Params` is created. Since `BTreeMap` manages memory automatically there is no need to manually handle memory allocation failures, Rust will panic if memory cannot be allocated.

Please also notice that `exit(28);` in the C code translates to `panic!()` in Rust, but it's not needed here because Rust handles memory issues automatically. If you want to handle memory allocation errors you need to use custom memory allocation which is not recommended unless absolutely necessary.</translated function>Given your function signature it seems like you want to implement the `new` function for the `Params` struct.
