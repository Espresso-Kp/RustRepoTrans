pub async fn lookup_by_contact(
        context: &Context,
        contact_id: ContactId,
    ) -> Result<Option<Self>> {
        let Some(chat_id_blocked) = ChatIdBlocked::lookup_by_contact(context, contact_id).await?

<translated function>
The provided C function `dc_get_chat_id_by_contact_id` is performing a lookup for a chat_id corresponding to a contact_id from a given `context` and it returns 0 if either the context is NULL, the context magic does not match with the expected value (DC_CONTEXT_MAGIC), or if the chat_id is blocked.

Translating it to the provided Rust function signature, the Rust function `lookup_by_contact` becomes as follows:

```rust
pub async fn lookup_by_contact(
        context: &Context,
        contact_id: ContactId,
    ) -> Result<Option<ChatIdBlocked>> 
{
    let chat_id_blocked: Option<ChatIdBlocked> = None;

    if context.inner.is_none() {
        return Ok(chat_id_blocked);
    }

    let inner_context = context.inner.lock().await?;
    
    let result = dc_lookup_real_nchat_by_contact_id(&inner_context, contact_id).await?;

    match result.blocked {
        Blocked::Not => Ok(Some(result.id)),
        _ => Ok(chat_id_blocked)
    }
}
```

This Rust function performs similarly to the C function, trying to lookup a `chat_id` by given `contact_id` in the provided `context`. It will return `None` if the context is not available (as opposed to checking NULL in C) or if the chat_id is blocked. Otherwise, it will return the `ChatIdBlocked` instance containing the `chat_id`. 

Please note that there might be differences between the C and Rust version due to the differences in libraries and tools you are using. The provided Rust function is a rough translation, and how it interacts with the other parts of your program can differ based on those other portions which aren't provided in this question. Specifically, you may need to adapt the code related to the statement `dc_lookup_real_nchat_by_contact_id`, which was assumed to be an equivalent functionality in Rust but was not provided.</translated function>The provided C function `dc_get_chat_id_by_contact_id` is performing a lookup for a chat_id corresponding to a contact_id from a given `context` and it returns 0 if either the context is NULL, the context magic does not match with the expected value (DC_CONTEXT_MAGIC), or if the chat_id is blocked.
