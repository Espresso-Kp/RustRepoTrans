    = help: items from traits can only be used if the trait is implemented and in scope
    = note: the following traits define an item `close`, perhaps you need to implement one of them:
            candidate #1: `SinkExt`
            candidate #2: `futures::AsyncWriteExt`
            candidate #3: `futures_lite::AsyncWriteExt`
            candidate #4: `futures_lite::io::AsyncWriteExt`
