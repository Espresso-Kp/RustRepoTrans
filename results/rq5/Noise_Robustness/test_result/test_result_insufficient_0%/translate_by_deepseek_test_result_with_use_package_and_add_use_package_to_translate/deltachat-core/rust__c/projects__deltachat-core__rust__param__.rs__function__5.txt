    = note: the following trait bounds were not satisfied:
            `param::Params: AsRef<_>`
            which is required by `&param::Params: AsRef<_>`
note: the trait `AsRef` must be implemented

    | ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
    = help: items from traits can only be used if the trait is implemented and in scope
    = note: the following trait defines an item `as_ref`, perhaps you need to implement it:
            candidate #1: `AsRef`
