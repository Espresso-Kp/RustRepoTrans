<translated function>
Here's the translated Rust function based on the provided Python function, Rust function signature, and dependencies:

```rust
pub fn add_external_address(&mut self, a: Multiaddr) {
    // In the Python version, multiple addresses were added.
    // Here, we're adding a single address as per the Rust function signature.
    self.external_addresses.insert(a);

    // Notify the swarm about the new external address
    let event = FromSwarm::NewExternalAddrCandidate(NewExternalAddrCandidate { addr: &a });
    self.on_swarm_event(event);
}
```

Note that this translation makes some assumptions:

1. The Rust struct has a field `external_addresses` which is likely a `HashSet<Multiaddr>` or similar collection that has an `insert` method.
2. We're using `self.on_swarm_event()` to notify about the new address, which matches the provided dependencies.
3. The `NewExternalAddrCandidate` struct is used to create the event, as it seems to be the most appropriate based on the provided dependencies.

This translation maintains the core functionality of adding an address, while adapting to the Rust function signature and utilizing the provided dependencies.</translated function>Here's the translated Rust function based on the provided Python function, Rust function signature, and dependencies:
