please translate the given python function to rust according to the rust function signature, rust function dependencies(including function and variable dependencies), and data type declarations and rust function dependency libraries I provide(delimited with XML tags).Please make sure to call the relevant dependencies as much as possible in the translated function Only response the translated function results.

<translated function>
Here's the translated Rust function:

```rust
fn is_running(&self) -> bool {
    self.inner.state.is_started() && !self.inner.state.is_finished()
}
```

Note that I've made some assumptions based on the provided Rust code:

1. The `is_started` and `is_finished` methods are likely part of the `PeriodicJobState` struct, which is accessed through `self.inner.state`.
2. The method names have been changed to follow Rust naming conventions (using `is_started()` and `is_finished()` instead of accessing fields directly).

If these assumptions are incorrect, you may need to adjust the code accordingly based on the actual implementation of your Rust structs and their methods.</translated function>Here's the translated Rust function:
