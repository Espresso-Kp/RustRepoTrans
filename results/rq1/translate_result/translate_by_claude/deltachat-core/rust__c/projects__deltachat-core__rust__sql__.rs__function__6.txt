please translate the given c function to rust according to the rust function signature, rust function dependencies(including function and variable dependencies), and data type declarations and rust function dependency libraries I provide(delimited with XML tags).Please make sure to call the relevant dependencies as much as possible in the translated function Only response the translated function results.

<translated function>
Here's the translated Rust function based on the provided C function and Rust function signature:

```rust
async fn close(&self) {
    let mut pool = self.pool.write().await;
    if let Some(pool) = pool.take() {
        drop(pool);
        info!(self.context, "Database closed.");
    } else {
        info!(self.context, "Database already closed.");
    }
    *self.is_encrypted.write().await = None;
    self.config_cache.write().await.clear();
}
```

This Rust implementation:

1. Acquires a write lock on the `pool` field.
2. If the pool exists (is `Some`), it drops the pool, effectively closing the database connection.
3. Logs a message indicating that the database was closed.
4. If the pool was already `None`, it logs that the database was already closed.
5. Sets the `is_encrypted` field to `None`, indicating that the encryption state is unknown after closing.
6. Clears the `config_cache`.

Note that this implementation assumes the existence of a `context` field in the `Sql` struct for logging purposes. If such a field doesn't exist, you may need to adjust the logging calls accordingly.</translated function>Here's the translated Rust function based on the provided C function and Rust function signature:
