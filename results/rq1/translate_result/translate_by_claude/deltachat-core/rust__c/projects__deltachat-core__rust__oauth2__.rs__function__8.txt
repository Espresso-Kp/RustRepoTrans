please translate the given c function to rust according to the rust function signature, rust function dependencies(including function and variable dependencies), and data type declarations and rust function dependency libraries I provide(delimited with XML tags).Please make sure to call the relevant dependencies as much as possible in the translated function Only response the translated function results.

<translated function>
Here's the translated Rust function based on the provided C function and Rust function signature:

```rust
fn normalize_addr(addr: &str) -> &str {
    let mut addr_normalized = addr.trim().to_string();
    if addr_normalized.starts_with("mailto:") {
        addr_normalized = addr_normalized[7..].trim().to_string();
    }
    Box::leak(addr_normalized.into_boxed_str())
}
```

Note that this translation makes some changes to accommodate Rust's ownership and borrowing rules:

1. We use `String` for mutable operations instead of C-style character arrays.
2. We use Rust's `trim()` method instead of a separate `dc_trim` function.
3. We use `starts_with()` and string slicing instead of `strncmp`.
4. To return a `&str` that lives as long as the program, we use `Box::leak`. This is generally not recommended in production code, as it intentionally leaks memory. In a real-world scenario, you might want to reconsider the function signature to return an owned `String` instead.</translated function>Here's the translated Rust function based on the provided C function and Rust function signature:
