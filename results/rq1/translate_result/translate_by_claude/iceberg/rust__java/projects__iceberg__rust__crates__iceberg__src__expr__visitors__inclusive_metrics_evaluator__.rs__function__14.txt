please translate the given java function to rust according to the rust function signature, rust function dependencies(including function and variable dependencies), and data type declarations and rust function dependency libraries I provide(delimited with XML tags).Please make sure to call the relevant dependencies as much as possible in the translated function Only response the translated function results.

<translated function>
Here's the translated Rust function based on the provided Java function, Rust function signature, dependencies, and libraries:

```rust
fn not_nan(
    &mut self,
    reference: &BoundReference,
    _predicate: &BoundPredicate,
) -> crate::Result<bool> {
    let id = reference.field().id;

    if self.contains_nans_only(id) {
        ROWS_CANNOT_MATCH
    } else {
        ROWS_MIGHT_MATCH
    }
}
```

This translation makes the following adjustments:

1. The function signature is updated to match the provided Rust signature.
2. The generic type `<T>` is removed as it's not present in the Rust signature.
3. `BoundReference<T>` is changed to `&BoundReference` to match the Rust signature.
4. `ref.fieldId()` is replaced with `reference.field().id` to access the field ID using the provided `field()` method.
5. `mayContainNulls.get(id)` is replaced with `self.contains_nans_only(id)`, which is a method provided in the dependencies that checks if a field contains only NaN values.
6. The `ROWS_CANNOT_MATCH` and `ROWS_MIGHT_MATCH` constants are used directly, as they are defined in the provided dependencies.

This translation maintains the logic of the original Java function while adapting it to the Rust environment and using the provided dependencies.</translated function>Here's the translated Rust function based on the provided Java function, Rust function signature, dependencies, and libraries:
