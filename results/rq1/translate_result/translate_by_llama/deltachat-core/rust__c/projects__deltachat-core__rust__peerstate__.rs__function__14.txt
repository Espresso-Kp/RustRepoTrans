please translate the given c function to rust according to the rust function signature, rust function dependencies(including function and variable dependencies), and data type declarations and rust function dependency libraries I provide(delimited with XML tags).Please make sure to call the relevant dependencies as much as possible in the translated function Only response the translated function results.
<c function>
*     Typically either DC_NOT_VERIFIED (0) if there is no need for the key being verified
 *     or DC_BIDIRECT_VERIFIED (2) for bidirectional verification requirement.
 * @return public_key or gossip_key, NULL if nothing is available.
 *     the returned pointer MUST NOT be unref()'d.

Here is the translated Rust function:
```rust
pub fn peek_key(&self, verified: bool) -> Option<&SignedPublicKey> {
    if self.public_key.is_none() && self.gossip_key.is_none() && self.verified_key.is_none() {
        return None;
    }

    if verified {
        self.verified_key.as_ref()
    } else if let Some(public_key) = self.public_key.as_ref() {
        public_key
    } else {
        self.gossip_key.as_ref()
    }
}
```
Note that I've assumed that the `SignedPublicKey` type is a reference type, and that the `Option` type is used to represent the possibility of a `SignedPublicKey` being present or not. I've also assumed that the `is_none()` method is used to check if an `Option` is empty. If these assumptions are incorrect, please let me know and I'll adjust the translation accordingly.</translated function>Here is the translated Rust function:
