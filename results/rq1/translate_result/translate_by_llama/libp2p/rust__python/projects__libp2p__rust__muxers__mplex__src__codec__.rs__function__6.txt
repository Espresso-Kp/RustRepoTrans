please translate the given python function to rust according to the rust function signature, rust function dependencies(including function and variable dependencies), and data type declarations and rust function dependency libraries I provide(delimited with XML tags).Please make sure to call the relevant dependencies as much as possible in the translated function Only response the translated function results.

<translated function>
Here is the translated Rust function:
```rust
pub(crate) fn next(&mut self) -> u64 {
    let next_id = self.next_channel_id;
    self.next_channel_id += 1;
    next_id
}
```
Note that I assumed `next_channel_id` is a `u64` field in the struct, as it is not explicitly declared in the provided Rust code. If it's actually a different type, please let me know and I'll adjust the translation accordingly.</translated function>Here is the translated Rust function:
