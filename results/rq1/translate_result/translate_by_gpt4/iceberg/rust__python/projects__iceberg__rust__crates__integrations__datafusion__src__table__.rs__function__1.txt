please translate the given python function to rust according to the rust function signature, rust function dependencies(including function and variable dependencies), and data type declarations and rust function dependency libraries I provide(delimited with XML tags).Please make sure to call the relevant dependencies as much as possible in the translated function Only response the translated function results.

<translated function>
In your provided Rust code, there doesn't seem to be an equivalent for "schemas" as in the Python function. However, based on the given data, a direct translation might look something like:

```rust
fn schema(&self) -> ArrowSchemaRef {
    // Presumably, self.schema in Rust is equivalent to self.schemas in Python
    // And there probably needs to be a way to get the current schema id, similar to self.current_schema_id in Python
    match self.table.get_table().get_schema_by_id(self.current_schema_id) {
        Some(schema) => Arc::clone(&schema),
        None => panic!("No matching schema found"),
    }
}
```

This should be modified according to the actual schema handling in your Rust code. There is no equivalent to Python's `next` expression in Rust, so we're using the `get_schema_by_id` method which likely needs be defined somewhere in your `Table` struct. And as Rust doesn't use exceptions for handing control flow (like Python does with `StopIteration` when no more items can be produced by `next`), we must handle the "no schema found" case explicitly. In this case, we panic, effectively crashing the program. If that's not desirable, you may want to return `Option<ArrowSchemaRef>` and replace `panic!()` with `None`.</translated function>In your provided Rust code, there doesn't seem to be an equivalent for "schemas" as in the Python function.
