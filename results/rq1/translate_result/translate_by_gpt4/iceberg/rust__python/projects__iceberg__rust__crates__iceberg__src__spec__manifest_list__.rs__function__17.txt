<translated function>
Based on the Python function and the Rust variables, functions, and dependencies provided, the rough translation of your Python function to Rust would be as follows:
```rust
pub fn try_into(self, partition_type: Option<&StructType>) -> Result<ManifestFile> {
    // once the manifest file is generated, no more entries can be added

    Ok(ManifestFile {
            manifest_path: self._output_file.location,
            manifest_length: self._writer.output_file.len() as i64,
            partition_spec_id: self._spec.spec_id,
            content: self.content(),
            sequence_number: self._sequence_number,
            min_sequence_number: self._min_sequence_number,
            added_snapshot_id: self._snapshot_id,
            added_files_count: Some(self._added_files as u32),
            existing_files_count: Some(self._existing_files as u32),
            deleted_files_count: Some(self._deleted_files as u32),
            added_rows_count: Some(self._added_rows as u64),
            existing_rows_count: Some(self._existing_rows as u64),
            deleted_rows_count: Some(self._deleted_rows as u64),
            partitions: construct_partition_summaries(self._partitions, partition_type),
            key_metadata: self.key_metadata,
    })
}
```
Please replace 'construct_partition_summaries' with your appropriate Rust function for constructing partition summaries. 

Moreover, Rust doesn't support classes and instances like Python. As such, methods must be implemented as part of a Structure's implementation block e.g. `impl MyStruct {...}`. The variables and methods with a dot preceding their names in the Python code, for example `self._output_file.location`, will need to have their equivalent in the `self` struct in Rust.

Please note that due to the differences between Python and Rust (for instance, they have different paradigms, approaches to error handling, and syntax), it's not always possible to do a one-to-one translation between the two. Certain logic or functionality may require a completely different approach to implement in Rust. Therefore, the above translation might needs some tweaks and adjustments to fit into your specific application's larger context, handle all edge cases, and follow Rust best practices. Sometimes, the lack of a specific context or additional implementation details of used functions or structures may limit the ability to provide a fully working rust function translation. These aspectsand feedback need to be taken into consideration.</translated function>Based on the Python function and the Rust variables, functions, and dependencies provided, the rough translation of your Python function to Rust would be as follows:
