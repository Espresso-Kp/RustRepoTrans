The corresponding Rust function could be:

```rust

    let d = (olen + sha - 1) / sha;
    let mut f: [u8; 64] = [0; 64];
    let mut u: [u8; 64] = [0; 64];
    k.iter_mut().for_each(|v| *v = 0); // empty the key

    for i in 1..=d {
        let len = salt.len();
        let mut four_bytes = [0; 4];

        // convert the integer i to bytes and append it to salt
        intto_bytes(i, &mut four_bytes);
        salt.extend_from_slice(&four_bytes);

        // Compute HMAC 
        hmac(sha, &salt, pass, sha, &mut f);

        salt.truncate(len); // reset salt to its original length
        u.copy_from_slice(&f[..]);
        for _ in 2..=rep {
            hmac(sha, &u, pass, sha, &mut u);
            for i in 0..f.len() {
                f[i] ^= u[i];
            }
        }
        
        // Copy f to the end of k
        let k_len = k.len();
        k.extend_from_slice(&f[..]);
        k.drain(..k_len); // remove the original contents in k
    }
    
    k.truncate(olen); // chop k to olen bytes
}
```

Notice that this function modifies its `salt` and `k` arguments. The original `PBKDF2` function in C modifies `s` and `key` but would not affect the original data because `s` and `key` are given as pointers rather than being passed by value. On the other hand, in Rust, `salt` and `k` are mutable references and modifying them would affect the original data. You could consider making a copy of `salt` and `k` before executing this function to preserve the original data.

In Rust, it is idiomatic to write functions in snake_case, i.e., `pbkdf2` instead of `PBKDF2`. The original C function modifies `s` and `key` but would not affect the original data because `s` and `key` are pointers. 

Please note that the `HMAC` function in C is replaced by the `hmac` function in Rust. The `OCT_empty`, `OCT_jint`, `OCT_copy`, `OCT_xor`, and `OCT_joctet` functions in C are replaced by equivalent operations in Rust. The `OCT_chop` function in C is performed by the `truncate` method in Rust.

Prerequisite: The `pbkdf2` function requires the `hmac` and `intto_bytes` functions already defined. These functions are part of code not provided but are necessary for the `pbkdf2` to work correctly. 

The `pbkdf2` function also uses methods and operations from slices, which are data structures in Rust for handling contiguous sequence of elements in memory.

Also please note that usage of these crates is also assumed:

You may need to adjust the implementation based on your exact setup and needs. This translation assumes a certain usage of types and functions based on the given context.</translated function>The corresponding Rust function could be:
