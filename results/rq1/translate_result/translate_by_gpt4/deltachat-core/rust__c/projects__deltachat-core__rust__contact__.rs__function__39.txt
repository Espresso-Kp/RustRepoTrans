<translated function>
In Rust, you would access the data of an object directly, instead of through getter methods. You would handle error checking and early returns through unwrapping and pattern matching. Here's how the equivalent Rust code might look:

```rust
impl Contact {
    pub fn get_name(&self) -> Result<&str, &str> {
        if self.id != DC_CONTACT_MAGIC {
            return Err("Error: Invalid contact ID");
        }
        Ok(&self.name)
    }
}
```

Here, `get_name` is a method of the `Contact` struct. It either returns a reference to the name or an error message. 

Please note: this depends on what DC_CONTACT_MAGIC refers to. My assumption here is that DC_CONTACT_MAGIC is an expected value of the contact's id. Maybe it's a constant you're using to check the validity of the contact. If that's the case, then the exact translation depends on how you've implemented that in Rust.

However, if DC_CONTACT_MAGIC is something entirely different, this translation would look different. As long as DC_CONTACT_MAGIC refers to a valid Id, the code above should be functionally equivalent to your C code. Also, please handle errors properly in the Rust code according to your application need.</translated function>In Rust, you would access the data of an object directly, instead of through getter methods.
