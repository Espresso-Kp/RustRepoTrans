please translate the given python function to rust according to the rust function signature, rust function dependencies(including function and variable dependencies), and data type declarations and rust function dependency libraries I provide(delimited with XML tags).Please make sure to call the relevant dependencies as much as possible in the translated function Only response the translated function results.

<translated function>
In your Python function, you are checking if a given encoding name is one of the specified string values and then performing `issubclass` operation using importlib.

In Rust, there are no direct equivalents for Python's `issubclass` function and 'importlib' library, also, dynamic loading of modules is something that's not really done in Rust.
So, the Python function cannot be directly translated to Rust without making significant adjustments.

However, part of the Python function concerned with checking if a given encoding name is part of a predefined set can be translated into Rust like the following:

```rust
pub fn is_multi_byte_encoding(name: &str) -> bool {
    let multibyte_encodings = [
        "utf_8",
        "utf_8_sig",
        "utf_16",
        "utf_16_be",
        "utf_16_le",
        "utf_32",
        "utf_32_le",
        "utf_32_be",
        "utf_7",
    ];

    multibyte_encodings.contains(&name)
}
```

This Rust function takes a string slice as input and checks whether it exists in the predefined array `multibyte_encodings`. It returns a boolean value.

For the remaining part, more context is required about how the function is used and what are the available alternatives in Rust. Make sure to have a comprehensive understanding of Rust's rules and memory safety precautions before trying to translate the function. Also, because Rust is statically typed, it doesn't provide the same level of dynamic typing like Python. Make sure to review the logic again before the final implementation.</translated function>In your Python function, you are checking if a given encoding name is one of the specified string values and then performing `issubclass` operation using importlib.
