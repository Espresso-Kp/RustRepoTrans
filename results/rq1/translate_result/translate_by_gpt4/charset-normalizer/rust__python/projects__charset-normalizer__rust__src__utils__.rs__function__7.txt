<translated function>
The below function will remove the accent from the character in Rust given the function signature, variable declarations, and library dependencies:

```rust
pub(crate) fn remove_accent(ch: char) -> char {
    use icu_normalizer::Normalizer;
    use std::char;

    let decomposed: String = DecomposingNormalizer::new().normalize(&ch.to_string());

    if decomposed.is_empty() {
        return ch;
    }

    let codes: Vec<&str> = decomposed.split_whitespace().collect();
    
    return match u32::from_str_radix(codes[0], 16) {
        Ok(code) => char::from_u32(code).unwrap_or(ch),
        _ => ch,
    };
}
```
This function uses the `DecomposingNormalizer` from the `icu_normalizer` crate to decompose the input character into its Unicode normal form D (NFD), thereby isolates all canonical combining characters (accents) from the character.

Please note: In original Python function, the string is decomposed into Unicode Standard Canonical Decomposition, where each accented character is decomposed into a base character plus an accent. In the translated Rust function, we are decomposing the character into its NFD (Normalization Form D: Canonical Decomposition) where the character is decomposed by canonical equivalence. As a result, the behaviour of `normalize()` method of `DecomposingNormalizer` in Rust should match `unicodedata.decomposition()` in Python. 

The remaining part of the code where hexadecimal value is converted to character is same in both Python and Rust.

If the decomposed string is empty, it returns the original character; otherwise, it returns the character corresponding to the hexadecimal Unicode code point.

Please add this function to your existing code in Rust and ensure that the character is not decomposed into empty string which is a string consisting only of canonical combining characters for accurate conversion. If there are any issues, you might need to add error handling code as per your requirement.</translated function>The below function will remove the accent from the character in Rust given the function signature, variable declarations, and library dependencies:
