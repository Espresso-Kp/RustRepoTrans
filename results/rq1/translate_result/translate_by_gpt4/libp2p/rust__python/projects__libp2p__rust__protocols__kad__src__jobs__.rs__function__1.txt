please translate the given python function to rust according to the rust function signature, rust function dependencies(including function and variable dependencies), and data type declarations and rust function dependency libraries I provide(delimited with XML tags).Please make sure to call the relevant dependencies as much as possible in the translated function Only response the translated function results.

Based on the given Python function and the corresponding Rust function signature, the function checks whether a certain instance is running or not. Here, it is assumed the `is_started` and `is_finished` properties are part of the struct (in Python it would be class attributes). Here is a general example:

```rust
impl PutRecordJob {
    fn is_running(&self) -> bool {
        self.is_started && !self.is_finished
    }
}
```

However, there are no `is_started`, `is_finished` fields in provided Rust structures such as `PutRecordJob`, `AddProviderJob`, `PeriodicJob`. Hence, you need to determine what constitutes a "running" state in these Rust structs. 

If fields `is_started` and `is_finished` don't exist on these Rust structs, the logic of the function needs to be re-imagined according to the given functionality of these structs.

*The response above stays true to the provided Python function. If this is not actually what the function should do according to some other logic, then the function should be adjusted accordingly.</translated function>Based on the given Python function and the corresponding Rust function signature, the function checks whether a certain instance is running or not.
