<translated function>
Your Python function accepts a sequence of `Multiaddr` and extends `self.addrs` with this sequence. In Rust, considering that the function signature you provided accepts a single `Multiaddr` instead of a sequence, you may want to translate this to add the given `Multiaddr` to some vector. This would look something like:

```rust
pub fn add_external_address(&mut self, a: Multiaddr) {
    self.addrs.push(a);
}
```

In this snippet, `self.addrs` is assumed to be a mutable vector of `Multiaddr`. If `self.addrs` is not a pre-existing variable in your struct, you will have to declare it as so:

```rust
pub struct YourStruct {
    addrs: Vec<Multiaddr>,
}
```

Please replace `YourStruct` with the actual name of your struct.

Please note that the Python code accepts a sequence of Multiaddr objects, while the Rust function only accepts a single Multiaddr. To match the functionality exactly, you might need to change the function signature to accept a vector of Multiaddr:

```rust
pub fn add_external_address(&mut self, a: Vec<Multiaddr>) {
    self.addrs.extend(a);
}
```

This Rust code behaves the same as the Python code now, extending `self.addrs` with multiple `Multiaddr` from the given vector.</translated function>Your Python function accepts a sequence of `Multiaddr` and extends `self.addrs` with this sequence.
