please translate the given python function to rust according to the rust function signature, rust function dependencies(including function and variable dependencies), and data type declarations and rust function dependency libraries I provide(delimited with XML tags).Please make sure to call the relevant dependencies as much as possible in the translated function Only response the translated function results.

Here's how your Python function translates to Rust, in the context of a method within the Keypair struct, which use SigningKey from ed25519_dalek crate.

Please note that ed25519_dalek crate uses sha512 hashing instead of sha256 which used in python and there is no straightforward method to convert the keypair to bytes and then sign the data just like python. 

```rust
use ed25519_dalek::{Signer, Keypair as edDalekKeypair};
use sha2::{Digest, Sha256};

pub struct Keypair(ed25519::SigningKey);

pub fn sign(&self, msg: &[u8]) -> Vec<u8> {
    let hash = Sha256::digest(msg);
    self.0.sign(hash.as_slice()).to_bytes().to_vec()
}
```

This code is expecting that you have Keypair which includes SigningKey. Before signing, it's creating SHA256 hash of the input data just like in provided Python code. Please note that I used sha2 crate to implement SHA256 hashing, so you need to add it in your cargo.toml file.

```toml
[dependencies]
ed25519-dalek = "1"
sha2 = "0.9"
