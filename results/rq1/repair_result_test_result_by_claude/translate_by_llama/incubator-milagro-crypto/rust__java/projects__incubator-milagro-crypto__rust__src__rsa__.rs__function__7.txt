error[E0005]: refutable pattern in local binding

    |         pattern `_` not covered
    |         missing patterns are not covered because `RFS` is interpreted as a constant pattern, not a new variable
    |         help: introduce a variable instead: `RFS_var`

    = note: `let` bindings require an "irrefutable pattern", like a `struct` or an `enum` with only one variant

    = note: the matched value is of type `usize`
