<reapir response>
Based on the error messages and the provided information, here's the corrected Rust function:

```rust
pub fn degrade_encryption(&mut self, message_time: i64) -> Result<()> {
    if self.prefer_encrypt == EncryptPreference::Mutual {
        // Since there's no `degrade_event` field, we'll skip this part
        // as it's not possible to directly translate without more context
    }

    self.prefer_encrypt = EncryptPreference::Reset;
    self.last_seen = message_time; // last_seen_autocrypt is not updated as there was not Autocrypt:-header seen

    Ok(())
}
```

Changes made:
1. Removed the `is_null()` check as it's not applicable to Rust's ownership model and the `Peerstate` struct.
2. Removed the `degrade_event` modification as this field doesn't exist in the Rust `Peerstate` struct.
3. Kept the `prefer_encrypt` and `last_seen` updates as they are present in the Rust struct.
4. Retained the `Result<()>` return type to match the function signature.

Note that this translation doesn't include the equivalent of `DC_DE_ENCRYPTION_PAUSED` as it's not defined in the provided Rust code. If this is an important part of the functionality, you may need to add a new field to the `Peerstate` struct to represent this state or handle it differently in the Rust implementation.</reapir response>
