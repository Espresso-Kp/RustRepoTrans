Based on the error messages and the provided context, here's the corrected Rust function:

```rust
async fn export_key_to_asc_file<T>(
    context: &Context,
    dir: &Path,
    id: Option<i64>,
    key: &T,
) -> Result<()>
where
    T: DcKey + Any,
{
    let is_default = id.is_none();
    let key_type = if key.is_public() { "public" } else { "private" };
    let file_name = if is_default {
        format!(
            "{}/{}-key-default.asc",
            dir.display(),
            key_type
        )
    } else {
        format!(
            "{}/{}-key-{}.asc",
            dir.display(),
            key_type,
            id.unwrap()
        )
    };

    info!(context, "Exporting key {}", file_name);

    delete_file(context, &file_name).await?;

    let asc = key.to_asc(Some((HEADER_AUTOCRYPT, ""));
    write_file(context, &file_name, asc.as_bytes()).await?;

    context.emit_event(EventType::ImexFileWritten(PathBuf::from(file_name)));

    Ok(())
}
```

Changes made:

1. Replaced `key.type_() == DC_KEY_PUBLIC` with `key.is_public()` to match the `DcKey` trait.
2. Removed the unused `dc_key_render_asc_to_file` function call and replaced it with `key.to_asc()` and `write_file()`.
3. Changed `file_name` from an `Option<String>` to a `String` to fix multiple errors related to `Option` type.
4. Used `write_file()` instead of directly writing to the file.
5. Removed the error logging and instead let the `write_file()` function handle any errors.
6. Changed the `ImexFileWritten` event to use `PathBuf::from(file_name)` instead of a tuple.

This implementation should resolve the compilation errors while maintaining the functionality of the original C function.</reapir response>
