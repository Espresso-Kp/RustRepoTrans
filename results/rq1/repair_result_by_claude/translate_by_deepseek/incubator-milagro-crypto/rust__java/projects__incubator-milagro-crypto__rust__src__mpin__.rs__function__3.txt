you were asked to translate the given java function to rust and execute your response and get some error message.
Fix the bug in your previous response according to error message, java function, rust function signature, rust function dependencies(including function and variable dependencies), and data type declarations and rust function dependency libraries I provide(delimited with XML tags).
Only response the function results.

Based on the provided information and the error message, it seems that the previous response was actually correct and didn't cause any compilation errors. The error message you provided is related to other parts of the project and not specifically to the `today()` function.

However, to ensure that the function matches the Java version as closely as possible, we can make a small adjustment to the calculation. Here's the slightly modified Rust function:

```rust
use std::time::SystemTime;
use std::time::UNIX_EPOCH;

pub fn today() -> usize {
    let start = SystemTime::now();
    let since_the_epoch = start.duration_since(UNIX_EPOCH).expect("Time went backwards");
    let milliseconds_since_epoch = since_the_epoch.as_millis();
    (milliseconds_since_epoch / (1000 * 60 * 1440)) as usize
}
```

This version calculates the time in milliseconds (like the Java version) before dividing by the number of milliseconds in a day. This should provide results that are more consistent with the Java implementation.

Note that this function still returns a `usize` as specified in the Rust function signature, which is different from the Java version that returns an `int`. If you need to change the return type to match Java more closely, you would need to modify the function signature.</reapir response>
