you were asked to translate the given java function to rust and execute your response and get some error message.
Fix the bug in your previous response according to error message, java function, rust function signature, rust function dependencies(including function and variable dependencies), and data type declarations and rust function dependency libraries I provide(delimited with XML tags).
Only response the function results.

Based on the provided information and the error message, it appears that there are no specific errors related to the `sub` function. The warning about future incompatibilities is not directly related to this function. Therefore, the original implementation seems correct. Here's the function again:

pub fn sub(&mut self, x: &Big) {
    for i in 0..NLEN {
        self.w[i] -= x.w[i];
    }
}

This implementation correctly matches the Java function and the Rust function signature. It subtracts each element of the `x.w` array from the corresponding element of `self.w`. The `NLEN` constant is assumed to be defined elsewhere in the codebase, likely in a `rom` module or similar.</reapir response>
