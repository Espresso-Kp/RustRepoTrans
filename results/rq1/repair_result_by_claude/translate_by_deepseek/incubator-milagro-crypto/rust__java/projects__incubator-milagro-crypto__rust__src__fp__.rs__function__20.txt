you were asked to translate the given java function to rust and execute your response and get some error message.
Fix the bug in your previous response according to error message, java function, rust function signature, rust function dependencies(including function and variable dependencies), and data type declarations and rust function dependency libraries I provide(delimited with XML tags).
Only response the function results.

Based on the provided information and error message, it seems that the previous response didn't have any compilation errors. However, I'll make some minor adjustments to ensure it aligns perfectly with the Java function and Rust dependencies. Here's the updated Rust function:

pub fn norm(&mut self) -> Chunk {
    let mut carry: Chunk = 0;
    for i in 0..(NLEN - 1) {
        let d = self.x.w[i] as u128 + carry as u128;
        self.x.w[i] = (d & BMASK as u128) as Chunk;
        carry = (d >> BASEBITS) as Chunk;
    }
    self.x.w[NLEN - 1] = (self.x.w[NLEN - 1] as u128 + carry as u128) as Chunk;
    (self.x.w[NLEN - 1] >> ((8 * MODBYTES) % BASEBITS)) as Chunk
}

This version:
1. Uses `Chunk` type consistently for `carry` and the return value.
2. Uses `u128` for intermediate calculations to avoid potential overflow.
3. Removes the unnecessary `result` variable and directly returns the calculated value.
4. Matches the Java function more closely in structure and logic.

These changes should maintain compatibility with the provided Rust dependencies and types while closely mimicking the behavior of the Java function.</reapir response>
