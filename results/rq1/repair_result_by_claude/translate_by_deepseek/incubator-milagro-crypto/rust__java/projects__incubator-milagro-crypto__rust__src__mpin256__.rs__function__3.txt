you were asked to translate the given java function to rust and execute your response and get some error message.
Fix the bug in your previous response according to error message, java function, rust function signature, rust function dependencies(including function and variable dependencies), and data type declarations and rust function dependency libraries I provide(delimited with XML tags).
Only response the function results.

<reapir response>
Here's the corrected Rust function based on the provided information:

pub fn today() -> usize {
    let start = SystemTime::now();
    let since_the_epoch = start.duration_since(UNIX_EPOCH).expect("Time went backwards");
    (since_the_epoch.as_secs() / (60 * 1440)) as usize
}

Note: The error message provided doesn't indicate any specific issues with the `today()` function. The function appears to be correct and should work as expected. The warning in the error message is related to a dependency (criterion) and not to the function itself. If you're still experiencing issues with this function, please provide more specific error information related to this particular function.</reapir response>
