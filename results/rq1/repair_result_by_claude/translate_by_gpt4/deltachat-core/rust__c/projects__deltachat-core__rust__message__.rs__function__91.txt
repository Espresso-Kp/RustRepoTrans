<reapir response>
Based on the error message and the provided information, here's the corrected Rust function:

```rust
pub(crate) async fn update_msg_state(
    context: &Context,
    msg_id: MsgId,
    state: MessageState,
) -> Result<()> {
    let sql = "UPDATE msgs SET state=? WHERE id=? AND (?=? OR state<?)";
    
    context.inner.sql.execute(
        sql,
        rusqlite::params![
            state as i32,
            msg_id.0,
            state as i32,
            MessageState::OutDelivered as i32,
            MessageState::OutDelivered as i32
        ],
    ).await?;

    Ok(())
}
```

The main changes are:

1. Removed the `prepare` step, as it's not necessary in this case.
2. Changed `params!` macro to `rusqlite::params!` to ensure we're using the correct macro.
3. Removed the `.unwrap()` calls on `state.to_i32()` and instead used `state as i32` for direct conversion.
4. Used `MessageState::OutDelivered as i32` instead of `DC_STATE_OUT_DELIVERED`.

These changes should resolve the thread safety issues mentioned in the error message and make the function more closely match the C implementation while adhering to Rust's async paradigm.</reapir response>
