Here's the corrected Rust function based on the provided information and error messages:

```rust
pub async fn send_locations_to_chat(
    context: &Context,
    chat_id: ChatId,
    seconds: i64,
) -> Result<()> {
    ensure!(
        context.is_open().await?,
        "Attempt to use a closed context."
    );
    ensure!(
        seconds >= 0 && !chat_id.is_special(),
        "Bad parameters."
    );
    
    let is_sending_locations_before = is_sending_locations_to_chat(context, Some(chat_id)).await?;

    let now = time();
    context
        .sql
        .execute(
            "UPDATE chats SET locations_send_begin=?, locations_send_until=? WHERE id=?",
            (
                if seconds > 0 { now } else { 0 },
                if seconds > 0 { now + seconds } else { 0 },
                chat_id,
            ),
        )
        .await?;

    if seconds != 0 && !is_sending_locations_before {
        let mut msg = Message::new(Viewtype::Text);
        msg.text = Some(stock_str::msg_location_enabled(context).await);
        send_msg(context, chat_id, &mut msg).await?;
        context.emit_event(EventType::MsgsChanged {
            chat_id: ChatId::new(0),
            msg_id: MsgId::new(0),
        });
    } else if seconds == 0 && is_sending_locations_before {
        let stock_str = stock_str::msg_location_disabled(context).await;
        chat::add_info_msg(context, chat_id, &stock_str, time()).await?;
    }
    context.emit_event(EventType::ChatModified(chat_id));

    if seconds != 0 {
        context.interrupt_location().await;
        dc_job_add(context, DC_JOB_MAYBE_SEND_LOC_ENDED, chat_id, None, seconds+1).await?;
    }

    Ok(())
}
```

This corrected version addresses the following issues:

1. Replaced `context.is_none()` with `context.is_open().await?`.
2. Changed `chat_id <= ChatId::new(DC_CHAT_ID_LAST_SPECIAL)` to `!chat_id.is_special()`.
3. Used the correct function names for `msg_location_enabled` and `msg_location_disabled`.
4. Replaced `add_info_msg` with `chat::add_info_msg`.
5. Changed `dc_send_msg` to `send_msg`.
6. Replaced `paramsv!` macro with a tuple for SQL parameters.
7. Used `context.interrupt_location().await` instead of `schedule_MAYBE_SEND_LOCATIONS`.
8. Emitted `EventType::ChatModified` instead of `EventType::MsgsChanged` for chat modification.
9. Removed the unused `NULL` parameter in `dc_job_add`.

These changes should resolve the compilation errors and make the function more closely match the C implementation while adhering to Rust idioms and the provided context.</reapir response>
