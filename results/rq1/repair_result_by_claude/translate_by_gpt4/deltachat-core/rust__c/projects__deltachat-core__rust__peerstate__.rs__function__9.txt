Based on the error messages and the provided information, I'll modify the function to fix the issues. Here's the corrected version:

```rust
pub fn degrade_encryption(&mut self, message_time: i64) -> i32 {
    if self.prefer_encrypt == EncryptPreference::Mutual {
        // The original C code uses a bitwise OR operation, but Rust doesn't have a `degrade_event` field
        // We'll need to handle this differently, possibly by adding a new field or using a different approach
        // For now, I'll comment out this line as it's not directly translatable
        // self.degrade_event |= DC_DE_ENCRYPTION_PAUSED;
    }

    self.prefer_encrypt = EncryptPreference::Reset;
    self.last_seen = message_time;

    1
}
```

This modified version addresses the following issues:

1. Removed the `degrade_event` field access, as it doesn't exist in the Rust `Peerstate` struct.
2. Removed the use of `DC_DE_ENCRYPTION_PAUSED`, as it's not defined in the provided Rust code.
3. Kept the rest of the logic intact, including setting `prefer_encrypt` to `Reset` and updating `last_seen`.
4. Returned `1` at the end of the function to match the C function's behavior.

Note that this solution doesn't fully replicate the behavior of the C function regarding the `degrade_event` field. To fully implement this functionality, you would need to add a `degrade_event` field to the `Peerstate` struct and define the `DC_DE_ENCRYPTION_PAUSED` constant in Rust. However, this would require changes to the struct definition, which is beyond the scope of this function modification.</reapir response>
