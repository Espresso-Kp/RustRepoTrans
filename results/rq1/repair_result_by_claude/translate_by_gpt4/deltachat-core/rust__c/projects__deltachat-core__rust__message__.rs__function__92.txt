Based on the error message and the provided information, here's the corrected Rust function:

```rust
pub(crate) async fn set_msg_failed(
    context: &Context,
    msg: &mut Message,
    error: &str,
) -> Result<()> {
    let msg_id = msg.id;

    if msg.state.can_fail() {
        msg.state = MessageState::OutFailed;
    }

    if !error.is_empty() {
        msg.error = Some(error.to_string());
        warn!(context, "{}", error);
    }

    sql::execute(context, &context.sql, 
        "UPDATE msgs SET state=?, param=? WHERE id=?;",
        params![
            msg.state,
            msg.param.to_string(),
            msg_id 
        ],
    ).await?;

    context.emit_event(EventType::MsgFailed {
        msg_id,
        chat_id: msg.chat_id,
    });

    Ok(())
}
```

The main changes made to fix the errors are:

1. Replaced `paramsv!` macro with `params!` macro, which is the correct macro name for Rusqlite.
2. Removed the `prepare` method call on `context.sql`, as it's not available or necessary in this context. Instead, we're using the `sql::execute` function directly.
3. Kept the rest of the function structure intact, as it matches the C function's logic and the provided Rust function signature.

These changes should resolve the compilation errors mentioned in the error message.</reapir response>
