<reapir response>
Based on the provided information and error messages, here's the corrected Rust function:

```rust
fn maybe_add_file(files_in_use: &mut HashSet<String>, file: &str) {
    const PREFIX: &str = "$BLOBDIR/";
    if !file.starts_with(PREFIX) {
        return;
    }

    let raw_name = &file[PREFIX.len()..];
    files_in_use.insert(raw_name.to_string());
}
```

This function should now compile without errors. The main changes are:

1. Changed `PREFIX` to a const `&str` instead of a macro-like definition.
2. Used `starts_with()` method instead of comparing substrings.
3. Used `PREFIX.len()` instead of a hardcoded length.
4. Called `to_string()` on `raw_name` to ensure we're inserting a `String` into the `HashSet`.

These changes address the issues in the previous implementation and should resolve the compilation errors related to this function.</reapir response>
