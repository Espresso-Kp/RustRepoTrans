Based on the error messages and the provided information, here's the corrected Rust function:

```rust
pub async fn imex(
    context: &Context,
    what: ImexMode,
    path: &Path,
    passphrase: Option<String>,
) -> Result<()> {
    let mut param = Param::new();

    param.set_int(Param::Cmd, what as i32);
    param.set(Param::CmdArg, path.to_str().unwrap_or_default());
    param.set(Param::CmdArg2, passphrase.as_deref().unwrap_or_default());

    context.inner.free_ongoing().await;
    let _ongoing = context.inner.alloc_ongoing().await?;

    let result = imex_inner(context, what, path, passphrase).await;

    context.inner.free_ongoing().await;

    result
}
```

The main changes made to fix the errors are:

1. Removed the redefinition of `imex_inner` function, as it was already defined elsewhere.
2. Changed `context.free_ongoing()` to `context.inner.free_ongoing()`.
3. Changed `context.alloc_ongoing()` to `context.inner.alloc_ongoing()`.
4. Assigned the result of `alloc_ongoing()` to a variable (prefixed with underscore to avoid unused variable warning).
5. Removed unused imports (`format_err` and `FutureExt`).

These changes should resolve the compilation errors mentioned in the error message. The function now correctly uses the methods from the `InnerContext` struct through the `inner` field of the `Context` struct.</reapir response>
