Based on the error message and the provided information, I'll modify the function to fix the dereferencing issue with `ChatId`. Here's the corrected version:

```rust
pub async fn get_fresh_msg_cnt(self, context: &Context) -> Result<usize> {
    if self.is_archived_link() {
        let query = "SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT(m.chat_id)) \
                     FROM msgs m \
                     LEFT JOIN chats c ON m.chat_id=c.id \
                     WHERE m.state=? \
                     AND m.hidden=0 \
                     AND m.chat_id>9 \
                     AND c.blocked=0 \
                     AND c.archived=1";
        
        let params = rusqlite::params![MessageState::InFresh as i32];
        
        context.inner.sql.count(query, params).await
    } else {
        let query = "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM msgs \
                     WHERE state=? \
                     AND hidden=0 \
                     AND chat_id=?";
        
        let params = rusqlite::params![MessageState::InFresh as i32, self.0];
        
        context.inner.sql.count(query, params).await
    }
}
```

This version addresses the following issues:

1. It handles the case for archived links separately, as in the C function.
2. It uses `self.is_archived_link()` to check if the chat is an archived link.
3. It uses `MessageState::InFresh as i32` instead of `DC_STATE_IN_FRESH`.
4. It doesn't dereference `self`, instead using `self.0` to access the inner value of `ChatId`.
5. It uses the correct enum `MessageState::InFresh` instead of `DC_STATE_IN_FRESH`.

This should resolve the dereferencing error and more closely match the functionality of the original C function.</reapir response>
