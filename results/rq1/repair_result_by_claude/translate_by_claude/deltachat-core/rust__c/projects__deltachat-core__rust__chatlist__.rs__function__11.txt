<reapir response>
Based on the error message and the provided C function, it seems the issue is not with the `get_archived_cnt` function itself, but with a test case. However, I'll provide an updated version of the `get_archived_cnt` function that should be correct and more closely aligned with the C implementation:

```rust
pub async fn get_archived_cnt(context: &Context) -> Result<usize> {
    let sql = "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM chats WHERE blocked=0 AND archived=1";
    let count = context.inner.sql.count(sql, []).await
        .context("Failed to get archived count")?;
    Ok(count)
}
```

This version:

1. Uses the `count` method from the `Sql` struct, which is more idiomatic for Rust and the provided dependencies.
2. Removes the unnecessary semicolon at the end of the SQL query.
3. Uses empty square brackets `[]` as params since there are no parameters in the query.
4. Keeps the error handling using `context` from the `anyhow` crate.

This implementation should work correctly and be consistent with the C function. The error you're seeing is likely in a test case, not in this function itself.</reapir response>
