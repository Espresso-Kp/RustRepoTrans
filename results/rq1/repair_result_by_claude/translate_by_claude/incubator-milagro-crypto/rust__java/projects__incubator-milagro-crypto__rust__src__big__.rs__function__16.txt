<reapir response>
Based on the error message and the provided information, the issue is that the `one` method is defined as private. To fix this, we need to make the method public. Here's the corrected Rust function:

```rust
pub fn one(&mut self) {
    self.w[0] = 1;
    for i in 1..NLEN {
        self.w[i] = 0;
    }
}
```

The only change made is adding the `pub` keyword before the `fn` declaration to make the method public. This should resolve the error and allow the method to be called from other parts of the codebase.</reapir response>
