Based on the provided information and error messages, I'll fix the issues in the previous response. Here's the corrected Rust function:

```rust
impl Peerstate {
    pub fn degrade_encryption(&mut self, message_time: i64) -> Result<()> {
        if self.prefer_encrypt == EncryptPreference::Mutual {
            // The `degrade_event` field is not present in the Rust struct,
            // so we'll skip this operation for now.
            // If it's necessary, you may need to add this field to the struct.
        }

        self.prefer_encrypt = EncryptPreference::Reset;
        self.last_seen = message_time;

        Ok(())
    }
}
```

This implementation addresses the following issues:

1. Removed the `DC_DE_ENCRYPTION_PAUSED` constant, as it's not defined in the Rust code.
2. Removed the operation on `self.degrade_event`, as this field is not present in the Rust `Peerstate` struct.
3. Kept the core functionality of updating `prefer_encrypt` and `last_seen`.

Note that this implementation doesn't include the equivalent of the C function's `degrade_event` update. If this functionality is crucial, you'll need to add a `degrade_event` field to the `Peerstate` struct and define the appropriate constants (like `DC_DE_ENCRYPTION_PAUSED`) in your Rust code.</reapir response>
