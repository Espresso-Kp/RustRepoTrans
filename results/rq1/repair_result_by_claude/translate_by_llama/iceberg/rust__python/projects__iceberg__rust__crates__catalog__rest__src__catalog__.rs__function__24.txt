<reapir response>
Based on the provided information and error messages, here's the corrected Rust function:

```rust
async fn drop_table(&self, table: &TableIdent) -> Result<()> {
    let endpoint = self.config.table_endpoint(table);
    let request = self.client.0.request(reqwest::Method::DELETE, endpoint)
        .body(reqwest::Body::empty())
        .build()?;

    self.execute::<ErrorResponse, NO_CONTENT>(request).await
}
```

This corrected version addresses the following issues:

1. Uses `self.config.table_endpoint(table)` instead of `self.table_endpoint(table)`.
2. Replaces `Request::builder()` with `self.client.0.request()` to create the request.
3. Uses `reqwest::Body::empty()` instead of `Body::empty()`.
4. Removes the separate `execute` method call and directly returns the result of `self.execute`.
5. Uses the `NO_CONTENT` constant for the status code.

Note that this assumes that the `execute` method is implemented on `RestCatalog` and not on `self.client`. If it's implemented on `self.client`, you would need to change `self.execute` to `self.client.execute`.</reapir response>
