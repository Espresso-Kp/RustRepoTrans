<reapir response>
 Based on the error messages and the provided Python function, Rust function signature, dependencies, and data type declarations, the issues seem to be related to the enum variant `AssertCreate` not being found and private field access in the `TableCommit` struct. Additionally, the method `_do_commit` is not found for the `Table` reference.

To fix these issues, we need to ensure that the `AssertCreate` variant is accessible and that the `TableCommit` struct can be properly instantiated. We also need to ensure that the `_do_commit` method is correctly called on the `Table` reference.

Here's the corrected Rust function:

```rust
pub async fn commit(self, catalog: &impl Catalog) -> Result<Table> {
    let requirements = vec![TableRequirement::AssertCreate];
    let commit = TableCommit {
        updates: self.updates,
        requirements,
    };
    self.table._do_commit(catalog, commit).await
}
```

This function assumes that `self.updates` and `self.table` are properly defined in the context where this function is called. The `TableCommit` struct is instantiated with the updates and requirements, and the `_do_commit` method is called with the catalog and the commit object.

Please note that the function signature and dependencies provided do not include the full context of the `Transaction` struct or the `Table` struct, which are necessary to fully translate the Python function. The function assumes that `self.updates` and `self.table` are accessible and correctly defined.

If you provide the full context of the `Transaction` and `Table` structs, I can further refine the translation.</reapir response>
