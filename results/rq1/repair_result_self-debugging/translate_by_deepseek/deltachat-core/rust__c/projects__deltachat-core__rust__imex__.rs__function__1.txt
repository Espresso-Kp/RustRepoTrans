 To translate the given C function to Rust and fix the errors based on the provided error messages, we need to ensure that the Rust function correctly matches the C function's behavior and dependencies. Here's the corrected Rust function:

```rust
use std::path::Path;
use std::ffi::OsStr;
use anyhow::{Result};
use futures_lite::FutureExt;
use crate::context::Context;
use crate::events::EventType;
use crate::param::Param;
use crate::job::{dc_job_kill_action, dc_job_add};
use crate::constants::{DC_PARAM_CMD, DC_PARAM_CMD_ARG, DC_PARAM_CMD_ARG2, DC_JOB_IMEX_IMAP};

pub async fn imex(
    context: &Context,
    what: ImexMode,
    path: &Path,
    passphrase: Option<String>,
) -> Result<()> {
    let param = Param::new()?;

    param.set_int(DC_PARAM_CMD, what as i32)?;
    param.set(DC_PARAM_CMD_ARG, path.to_str()?)?;
    param.set(DC_PARAM_CMD_ARG2, passphrase.as_deref().unwrap_or_default())?;

    dc_job_kill_action(context, DC_JOB_IMEX_IMAP).await?;
    dc_job_add(context, DC_JOB_IMEX_IMAP, 0, &param.packed, 0).await?;

    Ok(())
}

// Assuming ImexMode is an enum defined elsewhere
pub enum ImexMode {
    ExportSelfKeys,
    ImportSelfKeys,
    ExportBackup,
    ImportBackup,
}

// Assuming Param is a struct defined elsewhere with a method set_int and set
impl Param {
    pub fn new() -> Result<Self> {
        // Implementation of Param creation
        Ok(Param { /* fields */ })
    }

    pub fn set_int(&self, key: &str, value: i32) -> Result<()> {
        // Implementation of setting int
        Ok(())
    }

    pub fn set(&self, key: &str, value: &str) -> Result<()> {
        // Implementation of setting string
        Ok(())
    }

    pub fn packed(&self) -> &[u8] {
        // Implementation of packing
        &[]
    }
}

// Assuming dc_job_kill_action and dc_job_add are async functions defined elsewhere
pub async fn dc_job_kill_action(context: &Context, job_id: &str) -> Result<()> {
    // Implementation of job killing
    Ok(())
}

pub async fn dc_job_add(context: &Context, job_id: &str, priority: i32, data: &[u8], flags: u32) -> Result<()> {
    // Implementation of job adding
    Ok(())
}

// Assuming constants are defined elsewhere
mod constants {
    pub const DC_PARAM_CMD: &str = "cmd";
    pub const DC_PARAM_CMD_ARG: &str = "cmd_arg";
    pub const DC_PARAM_CMD_ARG2: &str = "cmd_arg2";
    pub const DC_JOB_IMEX_IMAP: &str = "imex_imap";
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Dependencies and Imports**: The Rust function imports necessary modules and dependencies, including `std::path::Path`, `std::ffi::OsStr`, `anyhow::Result`, `futures_lite::FutureExt`, and custom modules for `Context`, `EventType`, `Param`, `job`, and constants.

2. **Function Definition**: The `imex` function takes a `Context`, `ImexMode`, `Path`, and `Option<String>` as parameters.

3. **Param Initialization**: The `Param` struct is initialized using `Param::new()?`. The `?` operator is used to propagate errors.

4. **Setting Parameters**: The `set_int` and `set` methods of `Param` are used to set the parameters. The `set` method is used for string values, and `as_deref().unwrap_or_default()` is used to handle the `Option<String>` type.

5. **Job Management**: The `dc_job_kill_action` and `dc_job_add` functions are called to manage jobs. These functions are assumed to be asynchronous and return `Result<()>`.

6. **Error Handling**: The `?` operator is used to handle errors returned by the `set_int`, `set`, `dc_job_kill_action`, and `dc_job_add` methods.

This Rust function should now correctly translate the C function and fix the errors reported in the initial response.</reapir response>
