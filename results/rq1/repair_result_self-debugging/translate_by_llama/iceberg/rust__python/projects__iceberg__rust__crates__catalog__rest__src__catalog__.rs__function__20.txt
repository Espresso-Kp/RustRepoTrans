Here is the corrected Rust function:

```rust
async fn drop_namespace(&self, namespace: &NamespaceIdent) -> Result()> {
    let endpoint = self.namespace_endpoint(namespace);
    let request = Request::new(Method::DELETE, endpoint).build()?;
    self.client.execute::<ErrorResponse, _>(request).await?;
    Ok(())
}
```
