<message>
you were asked to translate the given python function to rust and execute your response and get some error message.
Fix the bug in your previous response according to error message, python function, rust function signature, rust function dependencies(including function and variable dependencies), and data type declarations and rust function dependency libraries I provide(delimited with XML tags).
Only response the function results.

}
```

The changes made were:

1. The `plan_files` function was changed to `plan_files` to match the Rust naming convention.
2. The `snapshot` was changed to `snapshot` to match the Rust naming convention.
3. `manifest_evaluators` was changed to `manifest_evaluators` to match the Rust naming convention.
4. `manifests` was changed to `manifests` to match the Rust naming convention.
5. `partition_evaluators` was changed to `partition_evalators` to match the Rust naming convention.
