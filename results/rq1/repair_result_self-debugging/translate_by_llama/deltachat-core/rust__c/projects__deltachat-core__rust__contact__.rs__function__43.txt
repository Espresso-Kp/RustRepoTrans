<reapir response>
Here is the corrected Rust function:

```rust
pub async fn get_profile_image(&self, context: &Context) -> ResultOptionPathBuf>> {
    if self.id == ContactId::SELF {
        let selfavatar = self.get(Config::Selfavatar).await?;
        Ok(selfavatar)
    } else {
        let image_rel = self.param.get(Param::ProfileImage).unwrap_or_empty();
        let image_abs = get_abs_path(context, image_rel);
        Ok(image_abs)
    }
}
```

Explanation of the corrections:

1. The `get` method was not implemented for the `Contact` struct. I replaced it with `self.get` method which is implemented for `Contact` struct.
