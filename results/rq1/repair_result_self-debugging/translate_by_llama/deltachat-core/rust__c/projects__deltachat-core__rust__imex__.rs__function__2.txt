<message>
you were asked to translate the given c function to rust and execute your response and get some error message.
Fix the bug in your previous response according to error message, c function, rust function signature, rust function dependencies(including function and variable dependencies), and data type declarations and rust function dependency libraries I provide(delimited with XML tags).
Only response the function results.
