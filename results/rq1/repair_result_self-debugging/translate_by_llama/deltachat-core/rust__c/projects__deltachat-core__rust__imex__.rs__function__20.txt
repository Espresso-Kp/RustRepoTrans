Here is the corrected Rust function:

```rust
async fn export_key_to_asc_file<T>(
    context: &Context>,
    dir: &Path,
    id: Option<i64>,
    key: &T,
) -> Result()>
where
    T: DcKey + Any,
{
    let file_name = if id.is_some() {
        format!("{}/{}-key-{}.asc", dir.display(), key.type() == DC_KEY_PUBLIC "public" : "private", id.unwrap())
    } else {
        format!("{}/{}-key-default.asc", dir.display(), key.type() == DC_KEY_PUBLIC "public" : "private)
    };

    info!(context, "Exporting key {} ", file_name);

    delete_file(context, file_name).await?;

    if key.render_asc_to_file(key, file_name, context).await {
        log_error(context,  "Cannot write key to {} ", file_name);
        return Err(format_err("Cannot write key to {}", file_name));
    }

    context.emit_event(EventType::ImexFileWritten(file_name));
    Ok(())
}
```
