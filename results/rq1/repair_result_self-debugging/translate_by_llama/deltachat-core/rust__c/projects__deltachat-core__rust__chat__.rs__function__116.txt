Here is the corrected Rust function:

```rust
pub async fn get_chat_media(
    context: &Context,
    chat_id: Option<ChatId>,
    msg_type: Viewtype,
    msg_type2: Viewtype,
    msg_type3: Viewtype,
) -> Result<Vec<MsgId>> {
    if context.inner.magic!= DC_CONTEXT_MAGIC {
        return Err(anyhow!("Invalid context"));
    }

    let mut stmt = context.inner.sql.prepare(
        "SELECT id FROM msgs WHERE chat_id=? AND chat_id!=? AND (type=? OR type=? OR type=?) ORDER BY timestamp, id;",
    )?;

    stmt.bind_int(1, chat_id.unwrap_or(ChatId::new(DC_CHAT_ID_ALL)).0));
    stmt.bind_int(2, DC_CHAT_ID_TRASH);
    stmt.bind_int(3, msg_type);
    stmt.bind_int(4, msg_type2);
    stmt.bind_int(5, msg_type3);

    let mut ids = Vec::new();

    while stmt.step().await == rusqlite::Result::Row {
        ids.push(MsgId(stmt.column_int(0)));
    }

    stmt.finalize().await?;

    Ok(ids)
}
