<message>
you were asked to translate the given c function to rust and execute your response and get some error message.
Fix the bug in your previous response according to error message, c function, rust function signature, rust function dependencies(including function and variable dependencies), and data type declarations and rust function dependency libraries I provide(delimited with XML tags).
Only response the function results.

Here is the corrected function:

```rust

    let new_name = improve_single_line_input(new_name>;
    /* the function only sets the names of group chats; normal chats get their names from the contacts */
    let mut success = false>;

    ensure! new_name.is_empty() "Invalid name>;
    ensure! chat_id.is_special "Invalid chat ID>;

    let chat = Chat::load_from_db(context, chat_id).await?;
 let mut msg = Message::default>;

 if chat.typ == Chattype::Group
 || chat.typ == Chattype::Mailinglist
 || chat.typ == Chattype::Broadcast
 {
 if chat.name == new_name {
 success = true;
 } else if!chat.is_self_in_chat(context).await? {
 context.emit_event(EventType::ErrorSelfNotInGroup
 "Cannot set chat name; self not in group".into>;
 } else {
 context
.sql
.execute(
 "UPDATE chats SET name=? WHERE id=?;",
 (new_name.to_string(), chat_id),
 ).await?;
 if chat.is_promoted()
 &&!chat.is_mailing_list()
 && chat.typ!= Chattype::Broadcast
 && improve_single_line_input(&chat.name)!= new_name {
 msg.viewtype = Viewtype::Text;
 msg.text = stock_str::msg_grp_name(context, &chat.name, &new_name, ContactId::SELF).await;
 msg.param.set_cmd(SystemMessage::GroupNameChanged);
 if!chat.name.is_empty() {
 msg.param.set(Param::Arg, &chat.name);
 } msg.id = send_msg(context, chat_id, &mut msg).await?;

 success = true;
 } context.emit_event(EventType::ChatModified(chat_id);

 } }

 if!success {

 } if sync.into() && chat.name!= new_name {

 chat.sync(context, SyncAction::Rename(sync_name)).await.log_err(context).ok();
 } Ok(())
}
