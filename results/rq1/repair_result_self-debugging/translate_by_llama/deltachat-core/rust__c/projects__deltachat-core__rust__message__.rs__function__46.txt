<reapir response>
Here is the corrected Rust function:

```rust
pub fn get_showpadlock(&self) -> bool {
    if self.is_none() || self.magic!= DC_MSG_MAGIC || self.context.is_none() {
        return false;
    }

    if self.get_int(DC_PARAM_GUARANTEE_E2EE, 0)!= 0 {
        return true;
    }

    return false;
}
