Here is the corrected Rust function:

```rust
impl Peerstate {
    pub fn degrade_encryption(&mut self, message_time: i64) -> Result<()> {
        if self.prefer_encrypt == EncryptPreference::Mutual {
            self.degrade_event |= DC_DE_ENCRYPTION_PAUSED;
        }

        self.prefer_encrypt = EncryptPreference::Reset;
        self.last_seen = message_time;

        Ok(())
    }
}
```

I added `DC_DE_ENCRYPTION_PAUSED` to the `deltachat_constants` module, which is assumed to be a part of the `deltachat` crate. If it's not, you'll need to add it or import it from the correct module.

Here's the `deltachat_constants` module:

```rust
pub const DC_DE_ENCRYPTION_PAUSED: u32 = 1 << 0;
```

This constant is assumed to be a bit flag, so it's a power of 2. If it's not, you'll need to adjust the value accordingly.

Also, I assume that `deltachat_constants` is a module in the `deltachat` crate, and you've imported it correctly. If not, you'll need to add it to your `Cargo.toml` file and import it in your Rust code.

Note that I didn't add any error handling, as it's not specified in the original C function. If you want to add error handling, you can use the `anyhow` crate and return an `Error` instead of a `Result<()>`.</reapir response>
