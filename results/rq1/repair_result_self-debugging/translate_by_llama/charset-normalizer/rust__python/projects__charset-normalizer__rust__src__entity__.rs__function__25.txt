The error message indicates that the `sorted` method is not found for `IntoIter<CharsetMatch>`. This is because `IntoIter` does not implement the `Sorted` trait. 

To fix this, we can use the `iter()` method to get an iterator over the `Vec` and then use the `sorted()` method on that iterator. However, since we are using Rust, we should use the `sort()` method instead of `sorted()`.

However, in this case, we are trying to sort the `Vec` of `CharsetMatch` objects. We can use the `sort_by()` method with a closure that compares two `CharsetMatch` objects.

But in this case, we are trying to sort the `Vec` of `CharsetMatch` objects, and we are trying to sort it in place. So we can use the `sort()` method.
