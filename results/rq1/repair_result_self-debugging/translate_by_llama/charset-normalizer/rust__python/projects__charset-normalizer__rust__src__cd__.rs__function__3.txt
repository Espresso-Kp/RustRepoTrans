Here is the corrected Rust function:

```rust
pub(crate) fn encoding_languages(iana_name: String) -> Vec<&'static Language> {
    let unicode_ranges = encoding_unicode_range(iana_name).unwrap_or_default();
    let primary_range = unicode_ranges.iter().find(|range| range.contains("Latin"));

    if primary_range.is_none() {
        return vec![&Language::LatinBased];
    }

    unicode_range_languages(primary_range.unwrap())
}
```
