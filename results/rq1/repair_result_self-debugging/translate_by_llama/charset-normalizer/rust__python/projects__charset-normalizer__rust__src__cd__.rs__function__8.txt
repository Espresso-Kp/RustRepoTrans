<message>
you were asked to translate the given python function to rust and execute your response and get some error message.
Fix the bug in your previous response according to error message, python function, rust function signature, rust function dependencies(including function and variable dependencies), and data type declarations and rust function dependency libraries I provide(delimited with XML tags).
Only response the function results.

Here is the corrected Rust function:

```rust
use crate::entity::{CoherenceMatch, CoherenceMatches, Language};
use ahash::HashMap;
use std::collections::HashMap;

pub(crate) fn filter_alt_coherence_matches(results: &CoherenceMatches) -> CoherenceMatches {
    let mut index_results: HashMap<&str, Vecf32>> = HashMap::new();

    for result in results {
        let language = result.language;
        let ratio = result.score;

        let no_em_name = language.replace("-", "");

        if index_results.contains_key(no_em_name) {
            index_results.insert(no_em_name, Vec::new());
        }

        index_results.get_mut(no_em_name).unwrap().push(ratio);
    }

    if index_results.values().any(|v| v.len() > 1) {
        let mut filtered_results: CoherenceMatches = Vec::new();

        for (language, scores) in index_results {
            let max_score = scores.iter().max().unwrap();

            filtered_results.push(CoherenceMatch {
                language,
                score: *max_score,
            });
        }

        filtered_results
    } else {
        results.clone()
    }
}
```
