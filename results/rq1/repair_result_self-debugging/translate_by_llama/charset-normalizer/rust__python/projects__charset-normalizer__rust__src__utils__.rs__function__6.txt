Here is the corrected Rust function:

use ahash::HashSet;
use encoding::{CodecError, DecoderTrap, Encoding, EncodingRef, StringWriter};
use icu_normalizer::DecomposingNormalizer;
use unicode_names2::name;
use std::borrow::Cow;

pub(crate) fn range_scan(decoded_sequence: &str) -> HashSet<String> {
    let mut ranges = HashSet::new();

    for character in decoded_sequence.chars() {
        let character_range = unicode_range(character);

        if let Some(range) = character_range {
            ranges.insert(range.to_string());
        }
    }

    ranges
}
```
