Here is the corrected Rust function:

```rust
pub fn hash(&mut self) -> [u8; 64] {
    let mut digest = [0u8; 64];
    let len0 = self.length[0];
    let len1 = self.length[1];
    self.process(0x80);
    while (self.length[0] % 1024)!= 896 {
        self.process(0);
    }
    self.w[14] = len1;
    self.w[15] = len0;
    self.transform();
    for i in 0..64 {
        digest[i] = (self.h[i / 8] >> (8 * (7 - i % 8))) as u8;
    }
    self.init();
    digest
}
```

However, there are several issues with the provided code:

1. `HASH512_K` is not defined in the provided code. It should be defined as a constant array of 80 u64.

2. `HASH512_H0` to `HASH512_H7` are not defined. They should be defined as constants.

3. `length` is not defined. It should be defined as a field in the `HASH512` struct.

4. `w` is not defined. It should be defined as a field in the `HASH512` struct.

5. `h` is not defined. It should be defined as a field in the `HASH512` struct.

6. `process(0)` is not defined. It should be defined as a method in the `HASH512` struct.

7. `transform()` is defined but it is not clear what it does. It should be documented.

8. `init()` is defined but it is not clear what it does. It should be documented.

9. `length` is not defined. It should be defined as a field in the `HASH512` struct.

10. `w` is not defined. It should be defined as a field in the `HASH512` struct.
