<message>
you were asked to translate the given java function to rust and execute your response and get some error message.
Fix the bug in your previous response according to error message, java function, rust function signature, rust function dependencies(including function and variable dependencies), and data type declarations and rust function dependency libraries I provide(delimited with XML tags).
Only response the function results.
