Here is the corrected Rust function:

```rust
pub fn decrypt(prv: &RsaPrivateKey, g: &[u8], f: &mut [u8]) {
    let n = prv.p.getlen();
    let mut g_mut = FF::new_int(2 * n);
    FF::from_bytes(&mut g_mut, g);
    let mut jp = g_mut.dmod(&prv.p);
    let mut jq = g_mut.dmod(&prv.q);

    jp.skpow(&prv.dp, &prv.p);
    jq.skpow(&prv.dq, &prv.q);

    g_mut.zero();
    g_mut.dscopy(&jp);
    jp.rmod(&prv.q);
    if FF::comp(&jp, &jq) > 0 {
        jq.add(&prv.q);
    }
    jq.sub(&jp);
    jq.norm();

    let mut t = FF::mul(&prv.c, &jq);
    jq = t.dmod(&prv.q);

    t = FF::mul(&jq, &prv.p);
    g_mut.add(&t);
    g_mut.norm();

    g_mut.to_bytes(f);
}
```
