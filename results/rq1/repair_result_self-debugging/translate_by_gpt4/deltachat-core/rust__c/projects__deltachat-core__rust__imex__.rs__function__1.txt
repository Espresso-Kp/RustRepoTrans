The error message is showing that there are numerous undefined types and functions. Undefined types can be solved by importing the required modules where they are defined. Based on the C function, `Action` should be `Job` and `job` should be `dc_job_t`. If it's also not defined in the code base, you further need to identify the equivalent Rust structures. Similarly, you need to import or define the function `to_string` and type `IV`.

The `Param` enum does not contain a `new` variant or associated item. You probably intended to create a `Param` instance and not a variant.

It seems that the main issue is that the required modules and traits are not being imported. Update the Rust function as follows:

```rust
use crate::job::Job;
use crate::context::Context;
use crate::param::Param;
use std::str::FromStr;
use std::path::Path;
use crate::job;

pub async fn imex(
    context: &Context,
    what: ImexMode,
    path: &Path,
    passphrase: Option<String>,
) -> Result<()> {

    let mut param = Param::default();
    param.set_int(Param::Cmd, what as i32);
    param.set(Param::CmdArg, path);
    match passphrase {
        None => param.set(Param::CmdArg2, ""),
        Some(pass) => param.set(Param::CmdArg2, pass.as_str()),
    }
    let job_to_kill = Job::from_str("ImexImap")?;
    let new_job = Job::from_str("ImexImap")?;
  
    job::kill_action(context, job_to_kill).await;
    job::add(context, new_job, 0, &param.to_string(), 0).await; 

    Ok(())
}
```
This assumes that the methods `to_string()`, `set_int()`, and `set()` exist for `param::Param`. It also assumes that the function `from_str()` exists for `job:Job` and the methods `add()` and `kill_action()` exist for the `job` trait. Note that `as_str()` method is used to convert String to &str.

Please, verify these in the respective modules and possibly choose a different solution if they don't exist. The updated function also uses a `default` method to create `Param` instance. You would need to implement `Default` trait for `Param` if it's not yet implemented:
```rust
impl Default for Param {
    fn default() -> Self {
        Param {
            // initialize the members
        }
    }
}
```
Remember to also handle the error properly with `?` operator, so make sure your function return type is something like `Result<(), YourErrorType>`. Replace `YourErrorType` with the error type used in your project.</reapir response>
