<reapir response>
The error is that the `params!` macro in rusqlite is using an array of `&dyn ToSql` references. Since `dyn ToSql` does not implement the trait `Sync`, `&dyn ToSql` cannot be passed between threads safely, and this makes the rusqlite `params!` macro unsuitable for use in async context.

The Sqlite write operation needs to be performed on a single thread which is not `Send` or `Sync`. So, weâ€™ve to use some sort of thread pool (like `tokio::task::spawn_blocking`) to execute this operation.

Here is the correct code:

```rust
pub(crate) async fn update_msg_state(
    context: &Context,
    msg_id: MsgId,
    state: MessageState,
) -> Result<()> {
    let state_i32 = state as i32;
    let msg_id_i32 = msg_id.0;
    context.inner.sql.call_write(move |conn| {
        conn.execute("UPDATE msgs SET state=? WHERE id=? AND (?=? OR state<?)", 
            rusqlite::params![
                state_i32, 
                msg_id_i32,
                state_i32,
                MessageState::OutDelivered as i32,
                MessageState::OutDelivered as i32
            ],
        )
    }).await?;
    Ok(())
}
```

In this updated version, rather than calling `execute` directly, we're using `call_write`.
This `call_write` method now takes a closure, which gets an Sqlite connection that is guaranteed to only be accessed by a single thread. This allows us to perform the non-thread-safe `execute` operation inside a safe context.
So, With this modification, rusqlite's â€˜`&dyn ToSql` cannot be shared between threads safelyâ€™ error is resolved.</reapir response>
