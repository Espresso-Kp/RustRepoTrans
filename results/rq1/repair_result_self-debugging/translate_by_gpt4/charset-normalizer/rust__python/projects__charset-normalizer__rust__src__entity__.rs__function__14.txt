Based on the error messages, it seems that the struct `CharsetMatch` does not have a `_languages` field and the `languages` function is private. According to the provided Python function, the `languages` function should return a vector of languages. 

The `_languages` in Python function is a member of `self`, but in the Rust `CharsetMatch` structure, there are no fields which would resemble language field. Also, Rust does not have private methods, but it does have private fields (by default), so the `languages` function described should be public.

Additionally, the Rust function does not match the signature provided as it should return a Vec of Language, not Vec<&str>. 

So the fixed function might look like this:

```rust
pub fn languages(&self) -> Vec<&'static Language> {
    let mut language_vec = Vec::new();
    for e in &self.encoding_languages {
        language_vec.push(e);
    }
    language_vec
}
```

This implementation assumes that a field or method named `encoding_languages` in struct `CharsetMatch` contains the available languages in the way similar to `_languages` in Python code. This naming is just a placeholder and needs to be replaced with the correct field or method name that provides similar data to `_languages` field in Python.

The function is also made public with the `pub` keyword.

Note: This is a basic solution and may need to be adjusted based on actual structure of `CharsetMatch` and other code specifics. Please replace `encoding_languages` with actual field or method that provides the necessary language data.</reapir response>
