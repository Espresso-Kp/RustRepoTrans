According to the error message, the method named `as_bound` doesn't exist for `UnaryExpression<T>` which was called in the `bind` function. Looking at the given python function, it seems the `as_bound` is a method of the current class to which the `bind` function belongs, and it contains some logic to create a `BoundUnaryPredicate` instance. 

In Rust we don't have such a function. However, since `as_bound` function isn't declared anywhere and we haven't provided its functionality in Python, we could only guess what could this function do. Judging by the name, we can assume that it converts some sort of value to a Bound value. But without the specific logic, it's hard to provide a bug-free code. 

We can conclude that the implementation of `as_bound` is missing, so we have to create it based on the custom logic of the `UnaryExpression` struct. For instance, the `as_bound` method would return the `Bound` type which is a type parameter of `UnaryExpression` struct. 

The following is an assumption without knowing the actual logic of as_bound:
```
impl<T> UnaryExpression<T> {
    fn bind(&self, schema: SchemaRef, case_sensitive: bool) -> Result<Self::Bound> {
        let bound_term = self.term.bind(schema, case_sensitive)?;
        self.as_bound(bound_term)
    }
    
    // Need to provide as_bound method
    fn as_bound(&self, bound_term: BoundTerm) -> Result<Self::Bound> {
        // convert bound_term to Self::Bound and return
    }
}
```
Please remember that this is a guess, and the actual function might be different depending on the implementation details of the type conversion. Given `UnaryExpression` object's properties could be utilized to convert `bound_term` to `Self::Bound`. The conversion logic entirely depends on the software being developed.

Also, it is vital to include all `use` statements at the beginning of your Rust Program.

Assumption is based on the provided context. For exact solution, more context need to be provided.
